<p>My own background is in communications and brand  strategy. I was  Head of Communications at Masternaut, one of the UK&rsquo;s  fastest growing  technology businesses, which featured in The Sunday  Times Tech Track  100 in 2007, 2008 and 2009, I worked closely with the  founder of the  business to help forge a unique brand identity and  proposition, helping  to create a brand that was distinct and elevated  from its many  commoditised competitors. We created incredibly successful  PR and  advertising campaigns, building awareness and advocacy for our  unique  business.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I believe in creating BRANDS - not BLANDS.  Brands are enduring, are  valuable and create lifelong fans and loyalty.  Blands on the other hand  wither away and die. You must make a choice!  Are you going to be a  BRAND or a BLAND?</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In 2010 I founded The  Art of Brand Storytelling, a strategic brand  consultancy to help  businesses of all shapes and sizes amplify the  powerful stories at their  heart. As well as providing strategic brand  and marketing advice, I  regularly speak at business conferences all  over the UK - sharing my  experiences and &lsquo;brand manifesto&rsquo; first hand.</p>

<p>Hi I&rsquo;m Alex. You  may remember me as one of Lord Sugar&rsquo;s candidates in series 6 of The  Apprentice. I&rsquo;ve joined Pimp My Cause as I think it has the power and  potential to make a huge difference to charities and organisations not  just in the UK, but all over the world. It&rsquo;s about crowdsourcing the  expertise of talented marketers who are hungry to get involved in making  a difference in society.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>As a Brand, Marketing and PR specialist, I&rsquo;ve  realised that the most successful organisations are often those that can  shout the loudest - and that means spending lots of money on big budget  campaigns. Not everyone has such deep pockets. There are causes out  there with amazing stories waiting to be told - they just need a  helping-hand to make themselves heard. By &lsquo;adopting&rsquo; a good cause,  talented people can help make a big difference, sharing powerful ideas,  expertise and creative thought. Pimp My Cause is a new era for  charitable organisations - and I&rsquo;m a staunch supporter!</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I look forward to  helping to spread the Pimp My Cause movement - helping many good causes  along the way.</p>

<p>Let your own Pimp My Cause story begin.... Get  involved!</p>

Are you open to testing new ideas, keeping the ones that work and ditching the ones that don't work? Are you looking for a fresh insight from someone with experience of what works in marketing?</p>
<p>If the answer to any of the above is yes, please read on and I'll explain how I can help you achieve all of the above.</p>
<p>I've always specialised in measurable marketing activity. My background was initially in direct marketing - direct mail, telesales, door drops and a wide range of other media. I've worked in financial services, utilities and telecoms, and in all of these sectors there is a real focus on the numbers, so I've had to adapt, learn and test new ideas over the years to find out what works and what doesn't.</p>
<p>From there, not surprisingly I've also built up a specialism for internet marketing, which is even more measurable still. I've built websites, helped clients get their sites found on Google, managed pay per click advertising campaigns and helped them make sense of their web analytics data.</p>
<p>If you're looking for support at a more strategic level, I can help with that too. I'm a tutor for the Chartered Institute of Marketing diploma programme and I regularly have to help students from a wide variety of industry sectors to put together their strategic marketing plans for their assignments.</p>
<p>If you'd like to know more, contact me. I'll be happy to give you a few pointers and see if there's a way that we can work together.</p>

<p class=NULLCompanyNameNULL>My current role involves marketing the International   Centre through various media. This includes the copywriting and design of   international marketing materials; newsletters; e-marketing; leaflets;   posters and newspaper advertisements. I also coordinate the development and   maintenance of the International Centre on the web, including writing content   for internal sites, such as the International Centre&rsquo;s section on the   Bradford College site, staff and student intranets, and external websites,   such as EducationUK and EnglishUK.</p>
<p class=NULLAchievementNULL>I am   responsible for developing and maintaining an Education Agent database to   support student recruitment, and have produced a suite of services to support   this group of stakeholders, including online information pages and an agent   pack, as well as regular group email updates.</p>
<p class=NULLAchievementNULL>Other   responsibilities have included planning and budgeting for international   marketing campaigns, developing newsletter and email templates and finding   new ways to communicate with the institution&rsquo;s stakeholders, including past,   current and future alumni.</p>
<p class=NULLCompanyNameNULL>Part of my role is the coordination of the College&rsquo;s   Erasmus Programme for incoming and outgoing staff and students. I manage the   Erasmus contract with the British Council, promote the programme, control and   monitor the budget, write reports and have developed processes for improved   administration of this project.</p>
<p class=NULLAchievementNULL>In this   role, I use the Microsoft Office   Suite (including Word, Outlook and Excel); Adobe Illustrator; Plone   (web-editing software); ACT! (CRM system).</p>

My tasks included dealing with the   planning and budgeting for the marketing of the business, developing new packaging   products for the company, and organising press releases for these   products.&nbsp; I would manage the direct   and email marketing myself &ndash; this would include coming up with a promotion,   liaising with a design team to create the look I wanted, providing them with   photographs or product shots I would like to use, writing copy for the   campaign, and then proofread the finished piece before emailing our   database.&nbsp; I have developed   marketing campaigns in English and French, extending the business from solely   UK-based to an international entity.</p>
<p>I also handled the database management and was instrumental in   improving the information in the database so that the contacts were organised   by industry, making it easier to create targeted campaigns.</p>
<p>I also dealt with the project management of orders that were   placed, dealing on a daily basis with large companies such as Google, Volvo,   Amazon, Oxfam and Barnardos. Website administration was my responsibility:   this included updating the site as I sourced new products and these were   added to our offering, and writing content for new pages.</p>

<p>Recently we  won Most Wanted Award by Aura (Associations of Users of Research); Best  Agency 2010 (MRS); as well as Best New Agency in 2008; and the most  prestigious Award for Excellence, 2010 (ESOMAR).</p>
<p>We  are also members of the professional bodies for market research,  including MRS (UK) and ESOMAR (International).&nbsp;</p>"	NULL	"<p>Truth was born in 2007 with a goal to bridge the gap between  mainstream research and pure consultancy. We've grown rapidly to a team  of more than 50 talented professionals, all driven by a belief that  truth can make a difference. The most successful strategies are those  which meet and anticipate change. We believe in the power of truth as a  driver of change: recognising it, understanding it, and creating it.</p>
<p>Truth  brings together an eclectic mix of expertise in business strategy,  brand development, innovation and communications. This mix means that we  are not tied to any one method - we have the freedom to focus on  delivering the best solution to your challenge.</p>
<p>We  help our clients build profitable brand and business strategies, based  on insight into the way people think, feel and behave - the deep and  distinctive truths our clients need to know to help their brands  succeed.</p>
<p>Our job is to find  truth, distil it, and bring it to life in a way that can change things  for the better. We love what we do and are hoping to put our experience  to good use and help out other organisations (not for profit) take their  brand and business to the next level.</p>"	"London, New York and Singapore"	"Strategic Insight Consultant"	"http://www.truth.ms/"	"1"	"0"	"1"	NULL	"london"	"51.508129"	"-0.128005"

<p>My approach is friendly, professional and disciplined. I don't believe in&nbsp;marketing for the sake of it - marketing should&nbsp;be&nbsp;effective and deliver ROI. For that reason, my passion is for developing comms strategies that are based on solid objectives, with strong audience insight at their core, and with sound evaluation so we can make sure we can learn and improve for next time.

I have a target to achieve every night and I receive a bonus if this target is achieved, I have reached it many times, I really enjoy interacting with customers and meeting new people. I also am on the production side of things making the photos and key rings, so I am good at time management getting the photos ready on time for the customers. I work individually.</p>

<p>I started this job soon after finishing at Chessington, I was one of the last Christmas temps to start working, so I had to adjust to it quickly the tills were very complicated, but I got the hang of it very quickly. I managed to get on with all the staff and become very confident at my job in a very short space of time. I worked on the tills, date rotated games, prepare for new releases, answer customer queries, up-sell insurance to customers (which I managed to get on the top of the staff leader board for), and also tidy the store to a high standard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I got a promotion shortly after joining, a senior host is an assistant to the team leaders, helping them in any way possible, I cash up after the days business, float in the tills at the beginning of the day, look after barrows, making sure the person on the stall is alright and they have enough stock etc, I delegate tasks to other staff making sure the daily tasks are done in that period of time. I am required to work under pressure as the park is very busy at times and lots of products get stolen in that time, customers are usually angry because of the queues, so I make conversation with them and calm them down. I give a high standard of customer service.</p>

<p>I have done some charity work for the charity FYD for young deaf people, with a group of other people we stood in the local shopping centre and signed to many Christmas songs from 9am-4pm. I did this every year from when I was age 6-17. Unfortunately it stopped running after this.&nbsp;</p>

Over the course of my experience as a bereavement and HIV crisis counselor, researcher and teacher in Death Studies, I heard hundreds of stories around the despair and isolation one feels after a loss. In particular, if the community in which the bereaved live ignores them these feelings of isolation are magnified and can become problematic. At CEDAR we aim to bring communities and individuals together by raising awareness, building confidence to talk about death, and helping people to prepare for death and/or help those who are bereaved.&nbsp;</p>"	"Shropshire, UK"	"Director"	"cedareducation.org.uk"	"1"	"0"	"1"	NULL	"Shrewsbury, UK"	"52.707302"	"-2.755327"

<p>I&nbsp;thrive on delivering marketing&nbsp;from&nbsp;'end to end'&nbsp;and therefore from identifying a need right through to seeing that marketing has delivered its goals be it&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;terms of behaviour change, sales or growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With my&nbsp;skills in customer resarch, I am able to&nbsp;understand what it is that customers need, how to find that gap and how&nbsp;best to&nbsp;fill it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;started my career in policy development and analysis so&nbsp;bring my keen strategic focus&nbsp;and analytical mind to&nbsp;the more traditional&nbsp;aspects of&nbsp;marketing&nbsp;and communications and strongly believe that marketing is not just about delivering a traditional advertising campaign, but also about working closely with organisations to understand the way&nbsp;they work, why&nbsp;they work in such a way and how to identify what is important to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marketing is just common sense at the end of the day and being in the right place at the right time.&nbsp; Hopefully, I can help ensure that we get there.</p>"	"London"	"Communications and Customer Research Manager"	NULL	"1"	"0"	"1"	NULL	"SM1 2SH"	"51.362610"	"-0.198491"

<p>During the last three years I have written a successful&nbsp; novel, (the follow-up is being done now), I&nbsp; enjoy playing golf, interacting with people from all walks of life, am flexible and enjoying seeing things through to the end result. I think it's fair to say my attention to detail is good but always with an eye on the big picture. I'm very can do in my approach and love pulling ideas together from everyone&rsquo;s input.</p>
<p>Good sense of humour and a very good listener. Honest and straight forward with people.</p>

Web, blogging and social media."	NULL	NULL	"A natural communicator and particularly extrovert in social situations. I thrive on getting the job done, things done and achieving tasks. I meet my commitments. When I say I am going to do something by a certain date, I find a way. I hold myself accountable so my boss doesnât have to.

I am an innovative problem solver. I look at things from different angles and turn problems on their side to come up with unique solutions. The harder the problem, the greater the challenge, I live to solve problems.

I am focused and do not lose it at the first sign of trouble or complexity, instead I remain calm and steady. I am low maintenance and donât whine and complain. I do not need to have my hand held for every little thing. I understand business implications of decisions and have the ability to display orientation to profitability I demonstrate knowledge of market and competition and align all work outputs with strategic goals.

I am genuine, confidential, direct, confident and comfortable in my own skin."	"Tunbridge Wells"	"Corporate Communications Manager"	NULL	"1"	"0"	"1"	"Lclarkpb"	"tunbridge wells, uk"	"51.132378"	"0.263695"

For the last 2 years I have been running my own marketing company and in May, I merged it with a client's business. Now our core offering is field marketing or as we like to call it; face-to-face marketing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Myself and a group of associates have also set up UK LaunchPad which helps international businesses to grow in the UK, from the UK. Between us we cover everything from strategic marketing to sales. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I am busy, but not too busy to help where I can. I am passionate about animal charities in particular and this seems like a great way to help when my time for volunteering is sadly scarce and erratic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My main areas of expertise are communications, positioning, finding customers and channels for your message. However, I have a great network of marketing associates who I am sure would also love to help out if there is anything else you need!&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><span><strong>Marketers &gt; Architects &gt; Artists &gt; Related Practitioners &amp; Interns in Residence Online with the Right&nbsp;to Manage -- London Borough of Ealing and Beyond</strong></span></em></p>
<p>The Arts &amp; Business Award-winning SARAG Guide TMO was founded in 1997, emerging creatively from two <strong><em>architects-in-residence</em></strong> studies (with the theme <strong><em>'Seeing is Believing'</em></strong>) led by architects John Thompson &amp; Partners in 1997 and&nbsp;2000 (<a href=NULLhttp://www.jtp.co.ukNULL>www.jtp.co.uk</a>.). SARAG now seeks to contribute radically to orienting as co-operatively managed <strong><em>&lsquo;shared-homes&rsquo;</em></strong>[3] all of Britain&rsquo;s council owned residential estates, starting with those of heritage-rich London Borough of Ealing as reviewed and profiled in 2005 by the architecture &amp; masterplanning consultancy EDAW/AECOM (<a href=NULLhttp://www.edaw.com)[4NULL>www.edaw.com)[4</a>].&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>NULLTHE FATHER OF ADVERTISINGNULL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>The <strong>RTM</strong> is in many ways&nbsp;akin to the <strong>&lsquo;Aided Self-Help&rsquo;</strong> social housing component of Puerto Rico&rsquo;s 1950s <strong>&lsquo;Operation Bootstrap</strong>&rsquo;: &nbsp;a smartly marketed made-in-the-Caribbean socio-economic development programme in which <strong>&lsquo;Father of Advertising&rsquo;, David Ogilvy</strong> played the lead role. This assignment, in his own words, he deemed his <strong>&ldquo;proudest achievement.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;So there we have it, the potential of the <strong>RTM</strong>, from the patriarch himself.[5]&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><em>The Right To Manage makes heritage count supremely: </em><em>&ldquo;The further backward you look, the further forward you can see&rdquo; -</em></strong><em>Winston S Churchill);</em><strong><em>&nbsp;&ldquo;Open your eyes and look, in this great future you can&rsquo;t forget the past&rdquo; &ndash; </em></strong><em>Bob Marley</em></span></p>
<p>London&rsquo;s Courtauld Institute art graduate Gillian Darley is an award-winning architectural and landscape journalist/author. Her biographies of celebrated 17<sup>th</sup> century diarist John Evelyn, the John Ruskin mentored social housing innovator, Octavia Hill[6], and legendary architect John Soane are all seminal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the work for which it appears she is most admired is <strong><em>Villages of Vision.</em></strong> In this she unveils a fascinating area of national heritage &mdash; a neat profiling of hundreds of <em>planned</em> <em>villages</em> across Britain and Ireland. Included are Ealing&rsquo;s Bedford Park and Brentham estates and four World Heritage Site candidates: Saltaire, Bournville, Port Sunlight&nbsp;(<a href=NULLhttp://www.portsunlightvillage.com/NULL>www.portsunlightvillage.com</a>) and New Lanark (<a href=NULLhttp://www.newlanark.org/NULL>www.newlanark.org</a>) &ndash; all characterised by at least a modicum of self-management [6].</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>NULLA&nbsp;REVOLUTIONARY INVENTIONNULL</strong></p>
<p>Council housing, one of Britain&rsquo;s truly revolutionary social inventions (easily ranking with the National Health Service in original intent), is in many ways a twentieth century up-scaled adaptation of Darley&rsquo;s visionary world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, alas, <strong>when the municipal architects&nbsp;created the council housing model[7] they mistakenly ignored Octavia Hill&rsquo;s self-management vision</strong> and the Ruskin/Morris preventative maintenance mantra (<em>&ldquo;Put protection in place &hellip; to stave off decay by daily care&rdquo;</em>). That mistake was confronted 20 years ago - when <strong>Sir George Young, then Ealing-Acton MP and Tory Housing and Planning Minister, piloted through the British Parliament &ldquo;<em>Statutory Instrument No. 627,</em> <em>The Housing (Right to Manage) Regulations 1994&rdquo;</em>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The period 1992 &ndash; 2013, saw three studies</strong> (by Price Waterhouse Coopers, Oxford Brookes University and Urban Forum/University of York) fully endorsing the RTM as the way to govern council-owned residential estates and blocks - see two examples:&nbsp;<strong><a href=NULLhttp://www.watmos.org.ukNULL>www.watmos.org.uk</a>&nbsp;&amp; <a href=NULLhttp://www.leathermarketjmb.org.ukNULL>www.leathermarketjmb.org.uk</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In 2002 the Tony Blair-led Labour Government extended the Right to Manage (RTM) regime to leasehold tenants in the private sector</strong> (<a href=NULLhttp://www.rtmf.org/NULL>www.rtmf.org</a>).&nbsp;(There is as yet no academic study of how&nbsp;collaboration between the two RTM regimes in the public and private sectors could impact positively on the co-op movement.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>NULLHOUSING MANAGEMENT CO-OPNULL</strong></p>
<p>However, <strong>coming right up to date, </strong>during this&nbsp;2014-2015 period, the 1994 RTM statute&nbsp;has had the benefit of three major boosts in LB Ealing: (1) residents of South Acton Estate&nbsp;registered a stunning 80% majority vote in favour of setting up their own housing management co-op (see below). Then, in the 2014 local election,the International Co-operative Alliance (ICA) saw&nbsp;its&nbsp;senior envoy on co-operative housing become an Ealing&nbsp;Ward Councillor. And now (3), the new MP for Ealing-Acton (elected in 2015) has declared co-operative housing fused with the&nbsp;garden city movement as high on her agenda.</p>
<p>All in all, taken together, this borough clearly has a claim to the RTM as a central feature of its patrimony[7].</p>

<p><span><strong><em>Milestones, Collaborations, Seminal Projects 1997 &ndash; Present</em></strong></span></p>
<p>The core of SARAG&rsquo;s work is its 18 years of action research and learning campaigning aimed at resident governance of South Acton and other residential council blocks and estates in Ealing. The campaign is heritage-guided and is inspired by the William Morris&rsquo; clarion call <strong>&lsquo;<em>to stave off decay by daily care&rsquo; [8].</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NULLHABITAT STEWARDSHIPNULL</strong></p>
<p>The South Acton/Southfield Neighbourhood (SAN) in&nbsp;LB Ealing (LBE) is a mix of residential and commercial estates, including the large, 30-hectare multi landlord,&nbsp;<strong>heritage-rich</strong> South Acton Housing Estate, majority owned by our council and represented since 1997 by the <strong>Arts &amp; Business</strong> <strong>award-winning</strong> SARAG.</p>
<p>The guiding mission of SARAG is the attainment of community governance of SAN<strong>.</strong>&nbsp; Clause 3.2 of SARAG&rsquo;s constitution mandates the organisation to: <em>&ldquo;promote, and become directly involved in the <strong>regeneration of the South Acton estate,</strong> in particular, and the Acton area</em> <em>as a whole in partnership</em> <em>with the London Borough of Ealing</em> &hellip;&rdquo; It is to this end that SARAG pursues <strong>the RTM option as</strong> <strong><em>a key investment</em></strong> <strong>in sustainable regeneration and self-managed habitat stewardship.</strong></p>
<p>Almost everything that SARAG does is action-researched. Within the national culture, council housing estates are considered places with wrongs that need fixing &lsquo;by the powers that be&rsquo;. Challenged to&nbsp;embrace&nbsp;Dr Booker T Washington's <strong><em>NULLCast Down Your Bucket Where You AreNULL</em></strong> philosophy,&nbsp;and&nbsp;to always start not with what is wrong, but with what's right about the place where they live, South Actonians have emerged as a community of resilient, audacious, confident and exemplary doers! This is&nbsp;a community engaged in a prolonged, aesthetics driven rebellion against the status quo. The Chinese have a saying for what is being sought: <strong><em>Pendeng&nbsp;Huli</em>&nbsp;= Equality and Mutual Benefit</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>NULLPARTICIPATIVE REGENERATIONNULL</strong></p>
<p>Thus, in 2010 SARAG&rsquo;s strictly residents-only Management Collective established the South Acton Community Builders Co-operative Ltd (SCBC) to pilot the 1994 statutory Right to Manage <strong>(<a href=NULLhttp://www.nftmo.comNULL>www.nftmo.com</a>&nbsp;&amp; <a href=NULLhttp://www.cch.coopNULL>www.cch.coop</a>)</strong> as a high value investment in sustainable habitat stewardship and heritage&ndash;led participative neighbourhood economic regeneration. The aim is to guide replication of the South Acton pilot elsewhere as a contribution to community empowerment generally and specifically to play a key role in the work&nbsp;of Co-operatives UK <strong>(<a href=NULLhttp://www.co-opuk.comNULL>www.uk.coop</a>)</strong> which is geared to healing the bruises recently suffered by the British sector of the international co-operative movement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;So, what if with the RTM, Britain&rsquo;s 2.5 million council tenants could be mobilised to play a vanguard role in restoring &lsquo;the co-op&rsquo; to its former glory? What if indeed &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;[1] The RTM statute of 1994 was designed to give a boost to the growth of Tenant Management Organisations (TMOs) However, it was not given the kind of fanfare advertising launch accorded the 1980 start-up of the Right to Buy (RTB). The National (NFTMO) has lamented that the RTM might be 'Britain's Best Kept Housing Secret'</p>
<p>[2] NULLParticipative regeneration intensifies the urgency of thinking ... (it) presuposes knowledge of places as well as processes ... all who have to participate need better knowledge, each of the other ... popular as well as professional understandingsNULL&nbsp;-- Architectural Historian&nbsp;Peter Guillery - <em><strong>(South Acton: Historic Environment Characterisation Study</strong></em> / English Heritage)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>[4]</em> Thanks to a campaign led by occupants of South Acton Estate in 2000, LB Ealing is one of Britain's local authorities with 'Retained Council Housing'. This is therefore a borough with great potential for a lead role in residential architecture design / redesign for self-managed habitat stewardship</p>

<p>#&nbsp;This registration&nbsp;seeks to invite expressions of interest(EOI) in our work.&nbsp;It is an invitation to both practitioners and student members of this PMC Network. It is a call for collaboration in the SARAG Guide TMO / RTM programme as it now takes the form of an online 'residency'. So, clearly, to participate,&nbsp;location is not an issue. Indeed, it is looking more like a 'guild of learning'; or even a department of the Bauhaus?</p>

<p>I look after a number of BAU campaigns for Coral, including the football season and a few of the key race meets (i.e. The Grand National) as well responding from a marketing perspective&nbsp;to the businesses ever increasing tactical needs. One of the smaller but most enjoyable demands on the tactical team is the development of PR stunts throughout the year, this involves both internal (and agency led) idea generation and the fulfilment of these ideas into a working campaign/stunt. We&nbsp;work with internal and external PR teams to seed these ideas into the media. Essentially these stunts exist to increase brand awareness around a particular event and provide a fun way for the public to engage with Coral.</p>
<p>&nbsp;An example of the most recent stunt I worked on was the Coral Jet Ski Grand National. Check out the video...</p>

<p>My duties for the Co-operative Bank included: Managed the ongoing Business Direct Marketing Program which consisted of a business-to-business mailing program with a 1.5 million database, Call handling and database analysis &amp; reporting. I helped to set up a control and measurement platform so that all mailings could be accurately reported on. Mailings were initially selected by SIC, turnover and geography, then mailed a basic letter (the most successful being a fake bank statement). Following on from the mailing companies would then have the opportunity call a free phone number that coming into our call centre; I was involved in the training of the call centre staff and the day to day management of the area. (All of the staff were trained by myself to a level equal or in some cases better than the banks own staff). All information requested by the callers had to be sent out within 24 hours of the call, a service level guarantee that The Co-operative Bank stipulated. We then reported on the results of the mailings directly to the account team at the bank on a regular basis, using the information to refine our targeting methods for future mailings, and to help influence the creative used for the mailing and follow up packs. While working on the Co-operative Bank account I rose from the level of team leader within the call centre to account manager in 3&frac12; years because of my dedication and ability to understand the account and my dedication to maintaining service levels and exceeding targets set for me by the bank.</p>"	"<p>Diploma in Direct &amp; Interactive Marketing from the Institute of Direct Marketing&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NULLdescriptionNULL>I am an experienced FMCG Marketer, passionate about consumers and shoppers interactions with products and brands. I developed my innovation and marketing skills during 12 years at The Coca-Cola Company with roles across several global brands. <br />When I joined GSK I had the fantastic opportunity to work on Lucozade, an historical 85 years old UK&amp;I brand that I successfully refreshed to unlock new growth for the decades to come. <br />In my experience as marketer, I have always been inspired by seeking a vision first, and then create the conditions to drive change. I am particularly fascinated by all topics around brand growth strategy and long range planning, and how these translate into a communication strategy and plan that ultimately change consumers perceptions and purchase behaviours. In most recent years, I became an acute observer of people dynamics, being able to work in team with positivity and confidence, leading others towards a common destination.<br />While at GSK, I realised I wanted to do Marketing for a better world in the years to come. I consequently decided to move to a new role within the partnership between GSK and Save the Children. My ambition in this new role is to create an effective communication plan to engage GSK at global level, with Save the Children activities. The aim is to bring people together in a joint effort to do business more responsibly, and ultimately make the difference on the ground, through fundraising and joint workstreams where the knowledge and expertise of both organisations come together.</p>

I just finished my graphic design degree in May 2014, after going back to school to start a new career. I enjoy retro and vintage design, particularly the use of silhouettes, and simple, clean lines. My personal motto is that the simpler something is, the better.</p>
<p>My software strengths lie with InDesign and Illustrator, and I'm always working to improve my PhotoShop comfort level and skills. Additionally, I love to edit, proofread and write; all skills that are valuable in marketing.</p>
<p>When I'm not designing, I love reading, watching movies, and learning new skills. I'm currently learning to sew, for which I have Project Runway to thank.

I've got myself a design job through sheer experience, and it's going good. Although as of yet I don't have a substantial portfolio, due to producing all my current work through a design firm.

<p>- planning campaigns to raise awareness of BT in a new market, targeting medium-to-large businesses - this included use of automated comms, so if someone had looked at X, it would trigger a follow-up email. I also led on developing new sales messaging to help BT move into new verticals</p>
<p>- developing a partner marketing programme to help BT leverage funds and brand association with partners, such as Cisco - from this I've developed excellent negotiation and influencing skills and a willingness to not be afraid to ask for favours and help</p>
<p>- a customer retention programme for BT's SME broadband customers - using data and intelligence to understand behaviours and reasons for churn and loyalty. &nbsp;I implemented a series of comms to help customers get more from their service, to build up loyalty and help sell more in a more&nbsp;personal way</p>
<p>- over-hauling social media at Informa - I set up a new approach to Twitter, developing a more regular and interesting posting strategy, tested polls, videos and imagery, developed a follower strategy and integrated it with other activities, such as PR and newsletters.</p>"	"<p>BA (Hons) in Business Studies, with focus on marketing</p>

</ul>"	NULL	"<p>Hi I'm Matt.</p>
<p>In my day job work as an Innovation Consultant for ?What If! Innovation. Put another way, I help big, global businesses figure out what to do next. Marketing strategy if you like. So this can either be developing and launching a new product, clearly defining the offering/proposition of a product/brand or simply helping companies understand what their audience's needs are and how they can satisfy them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not an obvious set of skills like webdesign or graphic design. So let me list some stuff to bring to life how I could maybe help...</p>
<p>Bigger/strategystuff...</p>
<ul>
<li>finding clarity out of a confusing challenge;</li>
<li>taking stakeholders on a journey;</li>
<li>scoping out a clear mission (for a challenge, cause, project) and setting the necessary people up to deliver proper impact</li>
</ul>
<div>More practical stuff...</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Making stuff (communications/websites/your mission) really, really clear for your (different) audiences</li>
<li>Designing/helping run fun and fruitful (innovation/ideas) workshops</li>
<li>Offering advice on how to properly use insight - and applying the learning</li>
<li>Advice on how to engage multiple stakeholders and deliver a consistent message</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>I guess another way to explain what I do is that its all about really understanding what an audeince wants and then building an offering around that. I think this is particualrly important given how much of a distrated world it is out there!</p>
<p>I'd love to get involved and do my bit for a good cause. I'm not sure if this website will email me when I have a message so probably best to use the website below.</p>

<p>I have worked in Brand Marketing for the last 15 years, mainly in the food &amp; drink arena, on brands such as Uncle Ben's, Pedigree, Baxters Soups, John Smith's, Newcastle Brown Ale &amp; Magners Cider and would now love to be able to put my skills &amp; experience to good use to help worthwhile causes.</p>
<p>Whether the subject matter is a can of soup, a bottle of beer or a local charity, I believe the basic principles of marketing are the same: Understanding who you want to speak to (be it sponsors, volunteers, local communities etc), being clear on what you can offer and how to best tell your audience how you can benefit them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, if you need any help with devising your marketing strategy and plans then do get in touch.&nbsp;</p>

The journey to finding my love for design was interesting -- at least I think so! I've always loved computers, and was one of those teenagers who spent most of their time gazing at a computer screen (you should see my eye prescription). I first became very interested in designing my MySpace pageback when it was the coolest thing since sliced bread. I changed my Myspace layout weekly, learning html to come up with ways to make it really cool and unique. From there I started taking every computer class my high school had to offer. I was programming constantly. The more computer classes I took, the more I realized I enjoyed the creative aspect over the mathmatical side... I've always been a right-brainer. I finally tried out the graphic design class in high school and fell in love with making posters, logos, book covers, and anything and everything in between! For the most part I'm drawn to create modern, minimalistic designs with clean and elegant ideas, and I enjoy edgy designs when they are called for. My versatility can be seen throughout my freelance work and other projects I've completed.</span></p>"	"Boston"	"Graphic designer"	"www.catrinajoki.com"	"1"	"0"	"1"	NULL	"01581"	"42.263889"	"-71.608002"

I am best used for support with any campaigns aimed towards young people and students, typically 16 - 21 years old but am keen to help out with other projects. I can prepare social media plans, audience research and provide other marketing support. I am passionate about marketing as a profession and equally enthusiastic that it can be a 'dog help dog' not 'dog eat dog' world if we all do our bit.

<p>I have recently been featured in the Cheltenham Illustration Awards (CIA) 2016 annual, under the theme &lsquo;Nonsense&rsquo;, from over 1,500 entries from around the world.</p>
<p>Book illustrations for The World Medical Fund, supporting children in Malawi. Working closely with the author, Faiz Kermani, I produced images that were bright and simple for children to enjoy. It is currently available to purchase end of January.</p>
<p>With the charity Gloucestershire Young Carers, I created a poster to advertise their fundraising tea party. The end product was a charming picture for them to use, and I was also able to exhibited work at the event, within the Pittville Pumprooms.</p>
<p>A book which has been published and written in German, Co- assisting Caterina Fischer with her book, 'Dein Leben ist mehr, als was du siehst'. I illustrated 28 full spreads , as well as the front cover. Through this I learned time-management, the graphic process and working with an author.</p>
<p><span>Another book I have produced a cover illustration for is John Dony's Victoria Swan, where I also created chapter titles.</span></p>
<p>Through a Travel-Bound competition, I managed to bag first prize with my photo of a train station in Antwerp.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I helped co-assist a workshop with Jake Lever for Cheltenham Open Studios, working with primary school children create art and explore materials. I then made a display for the outcomes.</p>
<p>I have exhibited at local craft fairs, using my visual experience to display products, as well as designing and creating decorations for various events I have helped manage. These include a hugely successful McMillian fundraiser, resulting in over &pound;400 raised, and a stall alongside the 2015 CIA at Stroud museum.</p>
<div>&nbsp;I have also attended stalls with my own work on them, including alongside the Cheltenham illustration awards at the Stroud Museum.</div>
<p>I have been published in the &lsquo;Unseen&rsquo;, a two tone risograph production, &lsquo;Olio&rsquo;, a compilation of graduate work, and have had work shown at the Angouleme comic festival, ELCAF, and the London Book Fair.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Lush Cheltenham</h4>
<p><span>August 2015</span>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span>August 2015</span></p>
<p><span><span>This was a small project in which I completed a mural. Differently to other murals, this was needed to retain some of the Lush look, and typography, which was a challenge. The brief was to create a mural that incorporates Lush beliefs and ethics, as well as new projects that had been launched as part of the summer range.</span></span></p>
<h3>Book Jacket Designer</h3>
<h4>All Saints Academy</h4>
<p><span>June 2015</span>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span>October 2015</span></p>
<div>
<p>This was a competition organised by All Saints Academy in conjunction with Cheltenham Festivals, where students from the Illustration degree pitched their ideas to students from All Saints Academy, who, through workshops, have compiled an anthology of poetry based on the title, 'Some of these Things are True'. I pitched my idea personally, and then produced an amended version with changes the students suggested. They went on to choose my design, and the anthology was published with my jacket on, and launched at the Cheltenham Literature Festival 2015.</p>

<h3>Workshop Co-ordinator</h3>
<h4>Oakwood Primary School</h4>
<p><span>June 2015</span>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span>June 2015</span></p>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This involved co-ordinating workshops for varying year groups at the primary school for their Art Week, the theme of which was 'Around the World'. We managed three different projects based on year area, and worked with staff to engage and excite students in collage techniques and 3D sculpture. We then decorated part of the school with what we made.</p>
<h3>Book Jacket Designer/Printer</h3>
<h4>Pittville Press</h4>
<p><span>April 2015</span>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span>April 2015</span></p>
<p>This was a collaborative book between students at the University of Gloucestershire, to create a limited edition printed book exploring what it means to be a designer. My position was not only the design of the cover and a page inside, but also the screen printing of the 60 editions with a fellow student Lizzy Mason.</p>
<h3>Graphic Designer</h3>
<h4>The Grand Old Uke of York</h4>
<p><span>April 2015</span>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span>April 2015</span></p>
<p><span><span>This was a logo commission for Yorkshire's most well known ukulele orchestra. it went on to be on all merchandise, as well as their music stands. They wanted something that was close to home, so we based the design on the famous 'Bile Beans' sign in York city centre. The brickwork is taken out for merchandise, but was requested for the music stands.</span></span></p>

<p><span>This was a temporary contract involving the design of an infographic banner to be printed for protests and other such events, that would be clear and effective, yet with all the relevant information.

<p>This Topshop wanted a mural painted in the staff area, of a landmark in their city, Gloucester Cathedral. It was painted in a loose style, in greys and blacks, with an orange accent. It brightened up the hallway, and staff loved having it to walk past.</p>"	NULL	NULL	"<p>I am a kind, reliable person who is fully commited to anything I am involved in.

I am currently in a musical production of Follies, in Cheltenham, which is due to my love of performance and has evolved my skills in public address. I love teaching, and relating to people of a younger age, as I feel I can connect to children well.

<p><strong>July 2015 - Present</strong></p>
<p>Currently training within the QA Gateway Programme in Web and Mobile Development learning industry standard techniques as well as the most up to date changes to a variety of coding languages. During the graduate programme I have also been taught a number of different skills, such as business analysis techniques, interpersonal skills, time management, presentation and interview preparation.</p>

<p><strong>Responsive Web Development:</strong></p>
<p>During training our focus was set to creating mobile first websites using responsive CSS3 coding in hand with our HTML5 code within the document object model. While practicing I also worked with graceful degradation and progressive enhancement to ensure I understood how to widen my webpage&rsquo;s browser support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>JavaScript Functionality:</strong></p>
<p class=NULLPredeterminadoNULL>The JavaScript covered in this section of training made sure we understood JavaScript types and operators as well as how to use flow of control in array&rsquo;s and number sequences. We went on to learn functions and create self-executing functions, implementing them into the DOM, then debugged our code to ensure no errors could occur. Regular expression in forms was also explored to ensure validation on the users&rsquo; side.</p>

I was forced to think on my feet in these situations and at the same time interact with the client to ensure they were happy, this lead to me being praised for my good work ethic and ability to juggle multiple tasks. When I wasn&rsquo;t assisting I would either be editing my own photographs with Adobe Photoshop or working on other peoples, my most recent retouching job was for Bricks Magazine&rsquo;s 3<sup>rd</sup> issue, working with a large number of photographs in a short time frame.</p>

<p><strong></strong><em>June 2015 to present</em></p>
<p>At the ICS group, I am responsible for planning and executing the marketing activities of Hobson Prior, a recruitment consultancy to the life sciences industry. I have worked to extend the company's online presence through LinkedIn campaigns, email marketing and developing website content. In 2015, I helped increase annual website traffic by 15%.</p>

The main source of data for the report is the results of a candidate survey; through email marketing, I was able to gain over 1,500 responses (almost doubling my target of 800).&nbsp;</p>

I have studied a broad range of subjects as part of my degree which are outlined in my CV, as well as studying French translation, interpretation, oral and listening skills. I studied the French economy and the mind set of French speaking countries. I possess excellent communication skills and I am proficient in the use of computers and related technologies. <br /> <br />I have excellent analytical and problem solving skills and I work well as part of a team or individually. Having studied Database technologies, Cloud Computing and E- Business in my final year I have a broad knowledge of the world of Ebusiness and how important it is, and will be in the Irish and worldwide economy. I have studied supply chain management in first and second year as well as consumer behaviour and various aspects of marketing and quality management. These subjects have left me with a keen understanding of the processes involved in order management and how a company can achieve a lean and effective S.C.M. system. I believe the key to achieving this is through maintaining good relationships throughout the supply chain, as well as working well as an individual. Having studied in France as part of my degree I have experience with dealing from all over the world and I have made some excellent contacts and friends from France, Germany and farther afield. <br /> <br />In October 2015 I undertook a degree course in Digital Technology and design, with an emphasis on Digital Marketing and project management. During the degree, I studied a range of different subjects as outlined above, which alongside my original degree have given me an excellent and up to date understanding of the digital environment in which we live. I finished this degree in October 2016 with a distinction awarded. <br /> <br />I am a creative and hardworking person and I know I would be an excellent addition to any project.</p>

With almost no budget I developed a support network consisting of a self-help group, a volunteer counsellor, an offline friend support scheme and a dedicated website.</p>
<p>Currently I regularly lend my business acumen to the non-profit sector as a Media Trust volunteer. For the last 5 years I have supported many organisations looking to improve their marketing and commercial opportunities, most recently&nbsp;a specialist alternative education provision offering curricular and vocational opportunities for girls in Southwark and surrounding boroughs.</p>
<p>During my career I have held a number of board level positions in the voluntary, private and public sector. Previously I was a board member for Housing for Women, in Lambeth, and a volunteer panel member and mentor for the Fredericks Foundation &ndash; a charity that helps disadvantaged people set up and expand their own business.</p>
<p>Currently I am part of an Executive Board providing commercial guidance and advice for an innovative operation, which will work in partnership with local colleges enabling 18-23 year olds to gain employment and apprenticeships in the building and construction sector.</p>
<p>I am also a Co-opted School Governor for a Primary School in Hertfordshire. Appointed by the governing body, I&rsquo;m not only committed to the good governance and success of the school; but act as a &lsquo;critical friend&rsquo; to scrutinize and steer the performance of the school in meeting its goals and objectives.</p>"	NULL	NULL	"<p>I am the founder and director of <strong>Maverick Marketing Consultancy</strong>. Since 2008 I have helped to grow a diverse portfolio of companies across London and Hertfordshire. Essentially I work with&nbsp;organisations to build and implement a system for growth, enabling them to scale their businesses to 6 and 7-figure companies.</p>
<p>My proprietary approach is to work with owner-managers to help better position and communicate their uniqueness in the market place; establish a results-focused framework for growth, and to implement marketing concepts and tactics geared at creating awareness, building trust and winning clients.</p>
<p>In 2011 I released the Amazon 5-star rated book <em>NULLMaverick Marketing: Essential Business-Building Strategies for Extraordinary Business GrowthNULL</em>,<em> </em>which is essentially a compilation of the key concepts and teachings taken from my private consultations and training.</p>
<p>A &lsquo;serial entrepreneur&rsquo; I was inspired to set up <strong><a title=NULLLondon Business AdviceNULL href=NULLhttp://www.londonbusinessadvice.co.ukNULL>London Business Advice</a></strong> in 2012. London Business Advice is unique in that our small network of advisors, like myself, are all business owners and so have a very &lsquo;real world&rsquo; understanding of what it takes to run a successful enterprise.</p>
<p>In 2014 I set up <strong><a title=NULLThe Business Plan WriterNULL href=NULLhttp://www.thebusinessplanwriter.co.ukNULL>The Business Plan Writer</a></strong> &ndash; having noticed another &lsquo;gap&rsquo; in the business support market. As a business enterprise adviser and trainer, and having spent almost 10 years&rsquo; reviewing and preparing business plans, I decided to start up a specialist consultancy. To date my professionally written business plans have already helped clients secure from as little as &pound;3,000 to over &pound;3.5 million in investment, enabling many businesses across the UK (as well as internationally) to expand and grow their operations.</p>
<p>Last year I was personally invited to contribute a chapter on the importance of business planning for the book 'The Crowdsourced Guide to Business' which contains over 250 pages of interviews from some of the UK&rsquo;s leading business experts.</p>

<p class=NULLp3NULL>Since the end of 2015, I&rsquo;ve worked as a creative designer at Visual Identity. This is a broad role, which has allowed me to work on a wide range of projects including both print and digital.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=NULLp3NULL>In print, I have taken on the responsibility for overseeing projects from start to finish, not only designing but managing clients, liaising with printers to maintain the best possible standards, value, and ensuring quality control via attending print runs.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=NULLp3NULL>Understanding the full product life cycle has broadened my understanding of the importance of individual stages across digital design. I continuously partner with developers to help better understand the possibilities and limitations of digital design. Further to this, I have set myself a challenge to increase my web development skills. In my spare time, I have continuously tried to further my knowledge by developing my own Wordpress site and learning how each section works. This has given me the confidence to learn and build/edit HTML emails.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=NULLp4NULL>Further to design, I have proven myself as a trustworthy and honourable employee. When both directors went to Australia on a business trip for 4 weeks they left me in charge. I supported my other colleagues by talking through difficult projects, checking work, liaising with clients, taking control of quotes invoices and delivering projects. At times this required me to work late and sometimes working weekends, I will always offer myself to go the extra mile, as I understand the importance of meeting deadlines and servicing clients to the best of my ability.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=NULLp1NULL>My understanding of design fundamentals and creative software packages, in combination with thorough planning and a keen eye for detail, enables me to push every project to achieve its full potential.</p>
<p class=NULLp2NULL><strong>ROLES &amp; RESPONSIBILITIES</strong></p>
<p class=NULLp1NULL>&bull; Producing and designing projects from brief to fulfilment ensuring consistency throughout work by referring to the brand guidelines.</p>
<p class=NULLp1NULL>&bull;&nbsp;Communicating with clients to progressively build on client relationships.</p>
<p class=NULLp1NULL>&bull;&nbsp;Researching thoroughly into each project in order to fully understand the brief and to generate original ideas.</p>
<p class=NULLp1NULL>&bull;&nbsp;Presenting finalised ideas and concepts to clients, colleagues and senior managers.</p>
<p class=NULLp1NULL>&bull;&nbsp;Ability to produce hand drawn or digital illustrations and icons.</p>
<p class=NULLp1NULL>&bull;&nbsp;Sourcing imagery for clients to build a brand identity.</p>
<p class=NULLp1NULL>&bull;&nbsp;Generate cost estimates and quotes via Streamtime.</p>
<p class=NULLp3NULL>&bull;&nbsp;Support the creative team on a daily basis.</p>

<p class=NULLp1NULL>I started working at LVC at the beginning of 2015. It was a great opportunity after university which allowed me to develop my understanding of design in digital. I was able to work alongside developers creating apps for tablets.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=NULLp1NULL>After the brief was given, the creative team would brainstorm together and plot out the user journey through the screens carefully focusing on user experience. Once we were happy I would then translate this into a fully functioning wireframe in Axure. When we were happy with the flow, I would then get to design the skin of the project.</p>

With almost no budget I developed a support network consisting of a self-help group, a volunteer counsellor, an offline friend support scheme and a dedicated website.</p>
<p>Currently I regularly lend my business acumen to the non-profit sector as a Media Trust volunteer. For the last 5 years I have supported many organisations looking to improve their marketing and commercial opportunities, most recently&nbsp;a specialist alternative education provision offering curricular and vocational opportunities for girls in Southwark and surrounding boroughs.</p>
<p>During my career I have held a number of board level positions in the voluntary, private and public sector. Previously I was a board member for Housing for Women, in Lambeth, and a volunteer panel member and mentor for the Fredericks Foundation &ndash; a charity that helps disadvantaged people set up and expand their own business.</p>
<p>Currently I am part of an Executive Board providing commercial guidance and advice for an innovative operation, which will work in partnership with local colleges enabling 18-23 year olds to gain employment and apprenticeships in the building and construction sector.</p>
<p>I am also a Co-opted School Governor for a Primary School in Hertfordshire. Appointed by the governing body, I&rsquo;m not only committed to the good governance and success of the school; but act as a &lsquo;critical friend&rsquo; to scrutinize and steer the performance of the school in meeting its goals and objectives.</p>"	NULL	NULL	"<p>I am the founder and director of <strong>Maverick Marketing Consultancy</strong>. Since 2008 I have helped to grow a diverse portfolio of companies across London and Hertfordshire. Essentially I work with&nbsp;organisations to build and implement a system for growth, enabling them to scale their businesses to 6 and 7-figure companies.</p>
<p>My proprietary approach is to work with owner-managers to help better position and communicate their uniqueness in the market place; establish a results-focused framework for growth, and to implement marketing concepts and tactics geared at creating awareness, building trust and winning clients.</p>
<p>In 2011 I released the Amazon 5-star rated book <em>NULLMaverick Marketing: Essential Business-Building Strategies for Extraordinary Business GrowthNULL</em>,<em> </em>which is essentially a compilation of the key concepts and teachings taken from my private consultations and training.</p>
<p>A &lsquo;serial entrepreneur&rsquo; I was inspired to set up <strong><a title=NULLLondon Business AdviceNULL href=NULLhttp://www.londonbusinessadvice.co.ukNULL>London Business Advice</a></strong> in 2012. London Business Advice is unique in that our small network of advisors, like myself, are all business owners and so have a very &lsquo;real world&rsquo; understanding of what it takes to run a successful enterprise.</p>
<p>In 2014 I set up <strong><a title=NULLThe Business Plan WriterNULL href=NULLhttp://www.thebusinessplanwriter.co.ukNULL>The Business Plan Writer</a></strong> &ndash; having noticed another &lsquo;gap&rsquo; in the business support market. As a business enterprise adviser and trainer, and having spent almost 10 years&rsquo; reviewing and preparing business plans, I decided to start up a specialist consultancy. To date my professionally written business plans have already helped clients secure from as little as &pound;3,000 to over &pound;3.5 million in investment, enabling many businesses across the UK (as well as internationally) to expand and grow their operations.</p>
<p>Last year I was personally invited to contribute a chapter on the importance of business planning for the book 'The Crowdsourced Guide to Business' which contains over 250 pages of interviews from some of the UK&rsquo;s leading business experts.</p>

<p><span>Until September 2016 I was the </span><span>Group Head of Marketing </span><span>for the Old Mutual Group, a FTSE100 company (with &pound;328 billion funds under management, operating in over 30 countries with 64,000 employees). A role that required leadership, direction setting and the ability to collaborate with and influence Heads of Marketing across the Group. As a result of the plc strategy to break the group into four stand-alone businesses and closure of the Head Office, my role came to an end. </span></p>

What does this mean for you the business owner? I hear you say. It means simplification, personalisation, personification and automation are 4 things you need to get control of.</p>
