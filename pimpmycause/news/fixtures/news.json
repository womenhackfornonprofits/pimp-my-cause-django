The process, which ran from September to December 2010, involved the NSPCC inviting 21 firms to tender.

It was among the 10 charities short-listed to make a brief presentation to a judging panel including communications guru Alison Canning and ex-Sun health editor Jacqui Thornton. The charity's communication manager Harriet Penning accompanied chief executive Sue Davie on the pitch. \"It was quite daunting because we hadn't done anything like this before,\" admits Penning.</p><p>Despite Penning's concerns that her charity would be overlooked in favour of more well-known names, Meningitis Trust was picked alongside Alzheimer's Society and Epilepsy Action. Each will receive &pound;50,000 of communications support during 2011. The Trust is focusing on a parliamentary campaign hooked on its 25th anniversary and raising brand awareness. \"Obviously this is a huge amount of money for a charity of our size,\" she says.</p><p>Formal schemes such A Just Cause have become much more common over recent years but do attract fierce competition. Communications agency Band &amp; Brown's annual scheme attracted interest from over 70 health and wellbeing charities last year. Mental health charity Mind finally won the pitch after an agency staff vote.</p><p>If your organisation has little or no experience of pro bono arrangements, using a broker can help you find the best fit.

  "content": "\"<div id=\"main-article-info\"><h1>Best bits - getting the most out of pro bono work</h1><h2 id=\"stand-first\" class=\"stand-first-alone\">We round up our experts' advice on how you can use pro bono work to its full potential</h2><div id=\"main-article-info\"><span>This article was written by</span><span> Kate Hodge</span><span> and published in </span>Guardian Professional, Friday 8 July 2011 13.04 BST</div><div><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/businesswoman-talking-in007.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></div><div>Best bits - getting the most out of pro bono work Photograph: Ryanstock/Taxi/Getty</div><div><h2>Paul Skinner - founder, Pimp My Cause</h2><p><strong>Use pro bono to get the expertise you need:</strong> Charities should consider pro bono as part of a broader trend to leverage external resources to support their mission &ndash; whatever the size of the organisation, most of the world's talent and resources lie outside its boundaries. Pro bono is a useful way of getting the help you need from specialists.</p><p><strong>Pro bono work can support CSR:</strong> Larger corporations understand the increasing need for sustainable development and, apparently, it is often the marketing department that block sustainable innovation. However, by collaborating on social and environmental projects on a pro bono basis for a few hours a week or a few days a year, corporate marketing teams can often learn more about social and environmental value than if they were to attend expensive training courses. This benefits the business as much as the charities they support.</p><h2>Alison Ingram and Martin Curtis - heads of projects, LawWorks</h2><p><strong>Pro bono is becoming more professionalised:</strong> Pro bono has become far more coordinated over the past 10 years. Some of the larger city firms have members of staff employed solely to organise pro bono and recognise the charitable work undertaken by their lawyers through their bonus structure and additional annual leave policies etc.</p><p><strong>Show appreciation:</strong> It is very important for not-for-profits to work at their relationships with corporate partners. Some smaller charities find it difficult to offer a great deal to the companies giving them pro bono advice, but in many instances, showing appreciation for the work they have done goes a long way. Offering help with the promotion of pro bono work internally at the company is often gratefully received. Many law firms get representatives from charities they have helped to speak at internal events to encourage more employees to get involved.</p><p><strong>Measure impact:</strong> We ask all applicants to report back on the effect of the pro bono work provided. This can range from an individual being able to remain in their home when a landlord is trying to evict them, to a charity being able to gain funding they otherwise would not have been able to access. We offer a summary of the impact reported to the law firms along with quotes from the people and organisations they helped. Lawyers also provide an End of Matter Report outlining what work was undertaken, how long this took and what it would have cost had the person been paying. This information can be used by the law firms for publicity and fed into their annual report or CSR review.</p><h2>Simon Cleobury - associate, Baker &amp; McKenzie</h2><p><strong>Treat pro bono clients as you would any other:</strong> Ensure that the recipients of pro bono advice receive the same standard of work as fee-paying clients by treating the work in exactly the same way. At Baker &amp; McKenzie all pro bono hours are treated as billable hours and are recognised in the lawyer's annual evaluation. Professionals are often very busy, so you need to manage a charity's expectations on delivery time in the same way as a paying client. Enter into engagement letters with pro bono clients to formalise the relationship.</p><p><strong>Partner up across corporations to deliver pro bono advice:</strong> Try teaming up with fee paying clients to carry out a pro bono project. For example at B&amp;M we worked with Accenture to provide advice to an international charity on all aspects of their data protection compliance programme. We also coordinated a global pro bono project for the Public Interest Law Institute (now PILNet) with Google.</p><p><strong>Use pro bono to build your portfolio:</strong> Pro bono work is a very good way of acquiring new skills. For example, pro bono matters provide lawyers, especially younger lawyers, with a great opportunity to build relationships with clients that they might not be able to do if the client had to pay fees. Pro bono work also often takes lawyers out of their areas of expertise, giving the lawyer essential experience outside their professional comfort zone.</p><p><strong>Pro bono is on the up:</strong> We have seen an increase in the amount of pro bono work over last year or so. This could be for a number of reasons. There is an increasing awareness amongst charities and NGOs that there is help out there and more importance being given to Corporate Social Responsibility. Law firms are now expected to have a strong pro bono programme and their employees are much keener to get involved with pro bono.</p><h2>David Hardie - head of venture philanthropy, Inspiring Scotland</h2><p><strong>Get the right support at the right time:</strong> At Inspiring Scotland we match a charity's needs with the skills of an individual or company. Performance advisors help every charity we support to ensure they make the most of their pro bono help.<br\/><strong><br\/>The cuts have been beneficial:</strong> Economic austerity has actually had a positive effect - it has created opportunities for professionals and businessmen to give more time to the third sector. While the economic climate has had a negative impact on their ability to give cash, professionals have become time rich.</p><h2>Harriet Penning - communications manager, Meningitis Trust</h2><p><strong>Establish some kind of agreement upfront:</strong> Both parties need to know where they stand. Have a formal discussion, where you can ask questions about what to expect and how the partnership will work. Type up the minutes from the meeting and distribute them - this way both partner's positions are clarified and the minutes can act as a reference tool if any issues arise. It's a two-way street and most charities recognise that they cannot expect to get all of the benefits without giving anything back.</p><h2>Laura Chambers - senior consultant, Just:: Health PR</h2><p><strong>Review your pro bono arrangement regularly and really commit to it:</strong> If the relationship is to be truly effective, it's crucial that both parties are clear on what they want from the partnership and review how things are going on a regular basis. Generally, pro bono charity partners do not expect any more than fee-paying clients do - in fact sometimes you will need to raise their expectations.</p><h2>Zoe Amar - head of marketing and business development, Lasa<a href=\"http://www.lasa.org.uk/\"><br\/></a><strong></strong></h2><p><strong>Choose your bro bono partner carefully:</strong> The bedrock of a good pro bono relationship, from a charity's perspective, is doing your research. Before you meet with a corporate, always go through their annual report, website and any other resources, and have a clear understanding of their CSR objectives.</p><h2>Isabel Evans - senior marketing manager, Media Trust</h2><p><strong>Clarity is essential:</strong> Some smaller charities can feel swamped by the amount of brilliant campaigns by others in the sector. But when a small charity has thought very clearly and carefully about their objectives, key messages, target audiences and realistic resources available, their successes speak volumes. Charities can often punch above their weight when they are clear internally and externally, about who they are, what they want to achieve, and how they are going to achieve it. Even if a charity is small and relatively sparsely resourced, having a clarity of purpose is very attractive to new partners and donors.</p></div><div><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/voluntary-sector-network/2011/jul/08/pro-bono-work-expert-advice\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.guardian.co.uk/voluntary-sector-network/2011/jul/08/pro-bono-work-expert-advice</a></div><ul class=\"article-attributes\"></ul></div>"

There's a great history of marrying causes to creative ideas in my profession, but this one is so good, it had to be worthy of special mention.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/pmc-logo-web.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p><p>Marketing expert and social entrepreneur Paul Skinner recently launched Pimp My Cause as an open platform matching professional marketers, including strategists, innovators, advertisers, designers and developers with great non-profits and charities that they can support not with their wallets but with their talent and expertise.</p><p>The free service allows professionals and organizations to register their needs and interests and to find their own best match. Some charities are already beginning to pull together whole teams of support through the platform, effectively using it as a virtual or &ldquo;open source&rdquo; marketing department.</p><p>Alex Epstein, who featured in series 6 of BBC TV&rsquo;s The Apprentice supported the launch as the first marketer to join the platform, and is already supporting a large national charity and a start-up social enterprise with his brand development and PR services.</p><p>After a month online, the platform now has nearly 100 charities signed up and over 200 professional members collaborating to market a better world. Early examples of work contributed through the site include a new digital campaign strategy for a regional office of the RSPCA, help producing a fundraising fashion show at an elite London venue for the Mayamiko Trust, and PR support for the social enterprise &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a person too!&rdquo;. High profile advisers include aladin, the former co-chair of the Cultural Strategy Group for London and John Marsden, chair of Innvotec, the longest running independent venture capital firm in the UK.</p><p>The platform rests on the underlying premise that the work contributed through the site is of benefit both to the causes and the marketers.</p><p>Independent marketers and communications agencies have often been locked out of the chance to participate in formal pro bono schemes not through lack of incentive bur rather through lack of access. &nbsp;Pimp My Cause completely opens up the opportunity for them to find a great cause to get involved with, giving them a chance to make new connections, address new challenges and build their portfolio and reputation.</p><p>The opportunities are interesting for larger corporations and their marketing staff as well. Large businesses sometimes struggle to get sustainable innovation through their marketing department. But by collaborating on social and environmental projects on a pro bono basis for a few hours a week or a few days a year, corporate marketing teams can often learn more about social and environmental value than if they were to invest in attending expensive training courses. This benefits the business with their CSR and sustainability agenda, as much as the charities they support and can also be a great way to boost staff morale.</p><p>An early case study sheds light on some of the insights to have emerged so far from the work contributed through the platform. UK Youth is a mid-size national charity that supports around 750,000 young people every year through various programmes. Over the 100 years they have been in existence their focus has been on project delivery, with funding coming from the public purse. In the current climate, they are acutely aware of the need to diversify their sources of income and promote their activity and appeal to potential new backers and supporters. These will either be members of the public or corporate partners. Marketing and branding can be very costly, but UK Youth are working with experts through Pimp My Cause to look at ways that they can &ldquo;leapfrog&rdquo; expensive above the line brand building, skipping to more participative interactive initiatives. They are developing a whole new way of working and re-defining the role that marketing can play in helping them grow as an organization.</p><p>Pimp My Cause marketers are encouraging charities to see pro bono as part of a broader trend to leverage new and previously un-tapped external resources to support their mission. &nbsp;Whatever the size of charity, large or small, most of the world&rsquo;s talent and resources lie outside its boundaries. Pro bono belongs alongside co-creation, co-production and social media initiatives as a means to efficiently and effectively achieve more than any organization can manage based on its internal resources alone.&nbsp;</p><p>Membership of Pimp My Cause is free for causes and for marketers &ndash; simply register at Pimp My Cause or write to Paul for further information. &nbsp;What are you waiting for&hellip;?</p><p><a href=\"http://www.thebigsociety.co.uk/about-us/blog/pimp-my-cause-launched-to-match-marketers-with-great-causes-to-whom-they-can-donate-their-talent/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.thebigsociety.co.uk/about-us/blog/pimp-my-cause-launched-to-match-marketers-with-great-causes-to-whom-they-can-donate-their-talent/</a></p>"

  "content": "<h1>Getting the most out of Pimp My Cause</h1><p><strong>Guest blog post by Ollie Smallwood</strong></p><p>Pimp My Cause is opening up new doors for the causes of Upbeat and Samrong Farm and therefore I was only too happy to accept Paul&rsquo;s offer to write a guest blog.<br\/><br\/>I represent the aforementioned two charities, both of which are featured on the Pimp My Cause site, and in the space of one fast-moving month each organization has benefited greatly from the wealth of contacts, knowledge and skills on offer through Pimp My Cause&rsquo;s network of marketing experts.<br\/><br\/>Paul has asked me to share my experience of using Pimp My Cause as a platform in the hope that other good causes can also find the help they require. Firstly, let me put this experience into context through summarizing the causes and why they were in need of some Pimp My Cause treatment.<br\/><br\/><strong>The Causes</strong><br\/><br\/><strong>Upbeat</strong> is a music and performance charity providing services to support people recovering from mental health issues. The organization offers the opportunity for its clients to build practical skills, self-confidence and self-esteem through weekly music workshops, recordings, live performances and social events.<br\/><br\/>The charity has grown steadily since being founded in Camden in 2004 and the demand for Upbeat&rsquo;s services is clearly evident through the referral of service users from 8 surrounding London boroughs. It is very much a community-based organization, supporting vulnerable members of society while offering uplifting events, which are open to all. Dare I say? &ndash; Upbeat is a big society idea that was dreamed up long before &lsquo;The Big Society!&rsquo; Jargon aside; it&rsquo;s clear and inspiring to see the positive impact that music and performance brings through inclusivity and instilling confidence in people from all walks of life.<br\/><br\/>Despite the success of Upbeat, an oversubscription to its services and patronage from the band Coldplay, recent local authority grant cuts have left the charity in need of reaching out to new supporters and funding. We are faced with the urgent need to market our cause more effectively and embrace the online community, social networks and any other avenues that could help raise our profile and increase our support base. Implementing such changes can represent a daunting challenge to a small organization but thanks to Pimp My Cause we&rsquo;ve been able to take several steps in the right direction.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/upbeatlogo.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/wwcf_logo.png\" alt=\"\"/><br\/><br\/><strong>Samrong Farm</strong> is a rural project, based just outside Phnom Penh in Cambodia that provides a home for orphans and underprivileged children while taking a pioneering approach to sustainable development through education, agriculture and caring for the environment. Like Upbeat, it is a small charity that relies heavily on volunteers and needs to keep it&rsquo;s marketing in order to reach out to new supporters and funders.<br\/><br\/><strong>Help Wanted</strong><br\/><br\/><strong>Upbeat:</strong> In advance of beginning a major fundraising campaign we were advised by professional fundraiser, Nigel Homer, to improve the Upbeat website and online marketing. With limited resources in terms of time and money we turned to PMC and posted a help wanted ad for web design and social media marketing.<br\/><br\/><strong>Samrong:</strong> Promotion of Samrong Farm is ongoing and relies heavily on visual material (brochures, presentations e.t.c.) to raise awareness of this overseas project. Again due to limited resources, the branding and design of key documents has been somewhat neglected and in need of attention so I posted an appropriate appeal on the Pimp My Cause site.<br\/><br\/><strong>Help Received</strong><br\/><br\/>Our exploration of the Pimp My Cause network of professionals and the subsequent help offered to both causes has exceeded expectations. So far Upbeat has already been lucky enough to benefit from collaboration with the following kind people:<br\/><br\/>1.Jeanette Clement gave some useful initial advice on web design and has agreed to stay in touch over possible further assistance in the future.<br\/><br\/>2. Zabisco &ndash; Marcus Marritt has offered some great tips on site content and social networking as well as agreeing to act as an ongoing consultant to Upbeat.<br\/><br\/>3. Ed Kemp &amp; Rob Porter &ndash; Following a recent meeting we are very excited about the prospect of working with Ed, a web producer and information architect, and Rob, a graphic and web designer, on the creation of a new website for Upbeat. Their support, enthusiasm and recommendations have already provided a boost to the cause.<br\/><br\/>We are enormously grateful to all of the above for donating their precious time and professional skills. In addition, I was delighted to hear from Paul Skinner, the driving force behind Pimp My Cause, about the chance to meet with John Grant (author, social entrepreneur and extremely bright marketing brain). A number of ideas for funding came out of our subsequent discussion as well as several further contacts and an awareness of John Grant&rsquo;s excellent book &lsquo;Co-opportunity&rsquo; (An inspiration for anyone looking to tackle social or environmental issues in our modern world).<br\/><br\/>In short, the seed that was sown through Pimp My Cause has grown into several shoots. It is still early days but it has been encouraging to find so much support for Upbeat.<br\/><br\/>With my immediate focus on Upbeat I have had less chance to pimp Samrong Farm as a cause. Fortunately, the Samrong help wanted ad on Pimp My Cause was spotted by Kathryn Liston, who has offered her expert skills as a graphic designer. Kathryn has already started to transform our marketing documents into a more cohesive and eye-catching offer that I look forward to presenting in the near future.<br\/><br\/><strong>Advice for Good Causes using Pimp My Cause</strong><br\/><br\/>In case they can be of assistance to fellow worthy causes, here are a few tips from our Pimp My Cause experiences to date:<br\/><br\/>1. <strong>Be proactive.</strong> In the case of Samrong Farm we benefitted from posting a help wanted ad, which was picked up and responded to by graphic designer Kathryn Liston. With Upbeat we needed to be more pro-active and contacted several professional marketers by sending them messages through the Pimp My Cause site. No one took offence at this direct approach and we have received good support and advice from all.<br\/>2. <strong>Be selective.</strong> Taking the time to browse the profiles of the professional marketers allowed us to select those whose skills are aligned to the aspirations of Upbeat.<br\/>3.<strong> Be patient.</strong> We received a fantastic response from all the marketing professionals that we approached on Pimp My Cause but soon came to appreciate that pro bono work has to be fitted around the respective day jobs. As a result, we need to allow time to achieve our goals but it doesn&rsquo;t mean that the support is any less committed.<br\/>4. <strong>Be realistic.</strong> At Upbeat we have a lengthy &lsquo;wish list&rsquo; of things that we would like to achieve, including some large projects such as building a new website. With individuals having limited time to give, I have found it useful to break down the work in order to spread the load. &lsquo;Many hands make light work&rsquo; e.t.c. This has the added benefit of widening the network associated with Upbeat as a cause.<br\/>5. <strong>Be grateful.</strong> This is something that Paul stressed in a previous news bulletin but we have been looking for alternative ways (other than financial) to reward anyone offering pro bono assistance. Hopefully we&rsquo;ll be able to promote their work to a wider audience, offer them a chance to improve their portfolio and, above all, give a great deal of thanks along the way.<br\/>6. <strong>Be engaging</strong> &ndash; It&rsquo;s always nice to be involved with something that people feel passionately about. We found that we have received an overwhelmingly enthusiastic response through creating a very short but enticing summary of Upbeat as a cause. We hope it serves to get marketers as excited about collaborating with Upbeat as we are about working with them.<br\/><br\/>Needless to say, I am a big supporter of Pimp My Cause and believe that it provides a forum for like-minded individuals and ultimately a platform for social change. Looking at it from a charity&rsquo;s perspective, it presents the opportunity to seek out and engage with professionals who wish to share their valuable skills for the benefit of good causes. In my experience, a relatively small investment of time and effort has yielded a great deal of assistance in return &ndash; surely a worthwhile resource for any organization.</p>"

What led you to write the book?</strong><br\/><br\/>Richard Hall: I love writing and I&rsquo;ve spent most of my adult life in marketing. That&rsquo;s the boring bit. Mostly I was getting madder and madder that nearly all the books written on marketing are as boring as dried rats&rsquo; poo. Yet marketing is the most exciting occupation ever&hellip;changing people&rsquo;s minds and behaviour and getting paid for it. But there&rsquo;s more. In a world where having lavish Russian, Chinese or Middle Eastern money is often seen as being enough to win, isn&rsquo;t it great to see creativity and customer insight do that jiu-jitsu, David-meets-Goliath trick.Finally marketing matters in a way that banking and high finance never will. Great marketing adds value. Great marketing changes sow&rsquo;s ears into silk purses with special secret containers that are branded Porky-Walky&copy; and are the only-in-thing to have. Marketing is magic.<br\/><br\/><strong>The David-meets-Goliath metaphor is one that many of our members understand very well indeed. Though in many cases, their ideal outcome is to get Goliath on their side rather than fight him. In that vein, could you explain your concept that marketing is like seduction and tell us what you mean by building your own &ldquo;seduction toolkit&rdquo;?</strong><br\/><br\/>No. I think Goliath businesses are past their sell by date. I want fast footed and open-minded. Which brings me to this seduction idea. Seduction tool-kit. That was a glib idea of mine. Sorry. It makes marketing seem too flippant when it&rsquo;s what really matters right now. Presenting well, telling well and being true to yourself. (By the way this seduction thing is not a Dominique Strauss Khan metaphor by the way, the man who made international finance more like the Sun than the FT. So that&rsquo;s what they mean by quantitative easing.) How can I put it? Marketing is sexy. Creating a relationship involves skill, love, care and good manners. Seduction, as I described it (or meant it) is about creating an allure of desirability around a product or service. A &ldquo;seduction toolkit&rdquo; is a dreadful phrase but what I meant was having a set of approaches to issues of presentation, description and selling of a product or brand that made it audible, intriguing, relevant and desirable. It&rsquo;s what we do when we&rsquo;re teenagers at one of those dances. Marketing is like the anti-wallflower movement and the making-conversation-easy elixir all blended together.<br\/><br\/><strong>The idea of a set of systematic approaches to building great marketing is very relevant to the challenges our members face. What three things do you think charities and non-profit organizations should take from the examples and advice in your book?</strong><br\/><br\/>Charities often behave as though they are different from more commercial institutions. But they aren&rsquo;t; they want your money just like Heinz does. So be unafraid of pitching a relevant story. And you want just three things from me&hellip;&hellip;.well, how about<br\/><br\/>-Tell people what it is that makes you special, interesting and worth supporting (and if you can&rsquo;t explain why you conform to each of those you have a problem) Philanthropy needs to inspire by its real relevance and any charity must empathise with its donors. Make it a story not a presentation.<br\/><br\/>-Know exactly what your story is, what your values are and what your bottom line is. Money is not the key issue, money never is. Engaging people and creating relationships with them is. You are never about just making a sale. You are always about creating a customer. These are very different things.<br\/><br\/>-Be a big fish in a small pond rather than an invisible fish in a big one. But you must be more ambitious and faster off the mark&hellip; remember what BMW said:- &lsquo;the big don&rsquo;t always eat the small but the fast always eat the slow.&rsquo;<br\/><br\/><strong>A unique approach, a great story and fast reactions &ndash; these are certainly the kinds of qualities our members need to develop to build the coalitions of support they need to fulfill their missions.</strong><br\/><br\/><strong>And speaking of which, this is the point in the interview where we ask you to pick out one or more of the non-profits on Pimp My Cause to apply your thinking to. So who have you chosen and why?</strong><br\/><br\/>There are a whole series of charities I&rsquo;ve been involved with &ndash; most notably Shaftesbury Young People &ndash; a children&rsquo;s charity I chaired for 11 years. The two charities I picked out of interest were Petit Miracle Interiors which seems to be akin to Emaeus here in Brighton but with a style edge, Feed the Hungry because in a century in which our increasing ability to grow greater quantities of and more nutritious food, anyone going hungry shouldn&rsquo;t be happening.<br\/><br\/><strong>Petit Miracle Petit Miracle Interiors Ltd (PMI) uses Interior Design to increase people&rsquo;s employability and to improve the home life of formerly homeless and vulnerable people. They teach a variety of accredited Level One Art and Design Courses that are completely open access, run taster days which provide a fun and interesting sneak peek into the world of Interior Design, and offer more intensive 6 week and 6 month accredited courses which lead to an Art and Design Diploma from the National Open College Network.</strong><br\/><br\/><strong>Richard, how do you believe that Petit Miracle could apply your ideas and what advice would you give them?</strong><br\/><br\/>Well they&rsquo;re doing so much right already. Good deeds not just good words. Yet what I saw in their manifesto was something beyond good - something a bit wonderful. We live in the world of self-improvement. Who&rsquo;d dare say because you&rsquo;re in an unfortunate economic position that you don&rsquo;t want some style in your life? But there are three things that drive great or even brilliant marketing ideas.<br\/><br\/>1. An appetite for success &ndash; a passion to win and an optimism that you can. &ldquo;You can&rdquo; &ndash; who said that?<br\/><br\/>2. An enthusiasm to make the brand or service burningly relevant. This is not left brain stuff - it&rsquo;s about an ability to say &ldquo;what if?&rdquo; and &ldquo;why not?&rdquo;<br\/><br\/>3. An almost childish desire to stand out, to be seen as different, to capture what little attention today&rsquo;s harassed customers retain &ndash; someone recently described &ldquo;attention&rdquo; as one of the global commodities in shortest supply.<br\/><br\/>If anyone can be imbued with these and review what they&rsquo;ve done, what they plan doing and their ambitions for their cause in the light of that my book and I might just be making a worthwhile difference. Or making someone &ldquo;angry&rdquo; enough to get up and try.<br\/><br\/><strong>That&rsquo;s really interesting. I would say that the organisations on Pimp My Cause that display these characteristics are exactly the ones that end up getting the most support from our marketers, in a sort of virtuous cycle. But to put you right on the spot, if you had to start work as marketing and business development director for Petit Miracle tomorrow, and were asked to give three practical suggestions for action that could lead to new marketing angles for them, what would they be?</strong><br\/><br\/>I love being put on the spot. We don&rsquo;t do this to anyone enough. www.onthespot.com So here&rsquo;s a go&hellip;..<br\/><br\/>1. Never trust a doctor who gives a diagnosis without examining you. So (as it were &ndash;and please don&rsquo;t take this utterly literally) I&rsquo;d ask them to get behind the screen and take their clothes off so I could examine them and every aspect of their business, what they do, why they do it, what they spend and where, what&rsquo;s gone right and what&rsquo;d been disappointing.<br\/>Only then could I give appropriate advice&hellip;.BUT here&rsquo;s some tentative further advice<br\/><br\/>2. Ask all the people in and around their organisation how they could do even better by them running a &ldquo;focus-group&rdquo; ( or how about a &ldquo;how-to-make-things-better-conversation&rdquo;) over a sandwich lunch.<br\/><br\/>3. Merchandise their people doing a before and after job on somewhere unpromising to prove precisely what they do and its effect and pitch it locally to every local radio and TV channel, local newspaper and on their website. Prove the story. Be interesting enough to be noticed.<br\/><br\/><strong>So to move from a relatively new social enterprise to an international organisation with substantial heritage, the other organisation you picked out was Feed the Hungry &ndash; they are a Christian organisation providing relief to those in need due to famine, drought, flood, war, and other natural disasters. Since 1987 Feed the Hungry has delivered over &pound;125 million GBP of relief supplies to over 92 nations worldwide. They have also established their &ldquo;Every Child Every Day&rdquo; programme with a</strong><strong> goal of feeding 100,000 children in need, and have already reached 31,000 children.</strong><br\/><br\/><strong>Globally they have established a range of business partnerships with food manufacturers and retailers who offer in kind support to their programmes. Their UK office is now looking to establish strategic business partnerships along similar lines, and also to launch a social media campaign around the message &ldquo;Take Away Hunger&rdquo; to raise public awareness and drive funding.</strong><br\/><br\/><strong>How would you advise them to make a success of these substantial goals albeit with a shoe string budget?</strong><br\/><br\/>I love what they do and their ideas but the story I want them to tell is not about just about famine but about the &ldquo;famine of ideas in our world&rdquo;. I just don&rsquo;t think enough of us are ashamed enough yet by this preposterous situation regarding world hunger.<br\/><br\/>In an otherwise reasonably sensible world we kill each other, brutalise each other and we allow each other to starve. Generation Y and Generation Z are liable to find the existence of famine absurd&hellip;&rdquo;just fix it&rdquo; would probably be their motto. &ldquo;Have some ideas&rdquo; they&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t sit around talking about how complicated it is. Try saying it&rsquo;s complicated to someone dying in front of you. It isn&rsquo;t; it&rsquo;s obvious&rdquo;&hellip;.The absence of ideas to solve this problem is what&rsquo;s really missing.<br\/><br\/>I think these wonderful guys at FTH need to be coached to be &ldquo;TV stars&rdquo; so they get to tell the story and their ideas fluently, dramatically and with fire. It&rsquo;s not expensive to fix this but it&rsquo;ll transform the impact their work has.<br\/><br\/>Shoestring budgets should be spent on making internal communicators brilliant not on paying external agencies.<br\/><br\/>The real story needs to be told by the actors themselves not by their critics or commentators.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"http://www.richardhall.biz/home.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.richardhall.biz/home.aspx</a></p>"

Could you start by telling us what led you to write your book, &ldquo;Branding Basics for Small Business: How to Create an Irresistible Brand on Any Budget&rdquo;?</strong><br\/><br\/><strong>Maria Ross:</strong> So many reasons! In my work as a brand strategist and consultant, I see so many businesspeople and executive leaders who gravely misunderstand what brand means or how it impacts the bottom line. Brand is more than just pretty pictures or a logo. It is reputation. It&rsquo;s the promise you make to customers and you need to communicate that consistently across visual, verbal and experiential elements. Good branding helps make sales easier and makes people contribute to your cause. I work with entrepreneurs and small to midsize growth companies on how to clarify, articulate and consistently represent a clear brand story in everything they do. And in doing so, I kept turning to the same key ten questions to get to the heart of the brand message. I decided to write this book to help educate on what brand is and why it matters and for those who simply wanted some guidance on how to craft their brand strategy on their own.<br\/><br\/><strong>What do you believe are the main benefits to come from that kind of brand development approach for non-profits &ndash; and given that a lot of non-profits have extremely tight budgets &ndash; how well do you believe the sector is placed to achieve more with less?</strong><br\/><br\/>Many non-profits are like scrappy small businesses: they try to do more with less. So your limited marketing actions have to be extremely effective. If you spend the time thinking through and clearly articulating your mission, benefits, target donor, value and personality &ndash; the essential ingredients of a fully-baked brand strategy - before going off and investing in a lot of random tactics, the brand will serve as a guidepost for making the right decisions and avoiding the wrong ones. You can ask, &ldquo;Is that the best tactic for our message, our image or our desired audience?&rdquo; If you don&rsquo;t have a brand strategy in place, it&rsquo;s hard to answer those questions wisely. For example, if most of your best donors don&rsquo;t use Twitter, should you really be spending time and money in a robust Twitter account?<br\/><br\/>Once the brand is clarified, it can then be conveyed consistently at every customer touchpoint, which helps you be more streamlined and efficient. Everyone involved and everything you do makes the same promise and tells the same story. Therefore you can pack more punch with less activity. Consistency helps you stay memorable and stand out in a sea of information and marketing &ndash; and will save you from getting confused with other non-profits.<br\/><br\/>But brand also helps attract the right audience to your cause with much more ease. If you clearly and consistently communicate the right story in the right place, you not have to work as hard &ndash; or spend as much money &ndash; building a loyal base of supporters. They will be attracted to you.<br\/><br\/>For example, the ASPCA http://www.aspca.org/ portrays a consistent brand visually so you always know you are getting communications from that group. That signature orange and gray, stylized font and use of imagery is hard to miss. This makes their message pack extra punch because now they become memorable across all media. In addition, their verbal story is encapsulated well in their tagline: We Are Their Voice. You know immediately that the animal itself is at the center of their cause, and that humans are required to stand up and speak for them. This translates into the stories on their website and in their newsletter: they always take the angle of how animals benefit from human actions.<br\/><br\/><strong>Pimp My Cause is all about scaling up the pro bono model of professional volunteering and applying it to marketing. Could you tell us about some of your own personal experience applying your ideas to non-profits as a pro bono marketer?</strong><br\/><br\/>I have helped develop brand strategies for a few non-profits, most recently for the Seattle Animal Shelter Foundation here in Seattle, Washington, USA. In all my projects, I&rsquo;ve polled all the various stakeholders for their brand impressions, the target donor profile, the organization&rsquo;s mission, etc. and I&rsquo;m able to bring the disparate opinions together to form one cohesive strategy that then gets communicated out in everything they do. It&rsquo;s like all guns firing in the same direction rather than scattershot! For example, with the Seattle Animal Shelter Foundation, we discussed the organization&rsquo;s &ldquo;personality&rdquo; and which other non-profits they wanted to emulate &ndash; or avoid like the plague! We also created Ideal Donor Profiles that help guide their marketing activities. Once everyone is on the same page, you can all steer the ship more quickly in the right direction!<br\/><br\/><strong>Well Maria, this is the part of the interview where we put you on the spot and ask you to apply your thinking to one of the non-profits listed on Pimp My Cause, so which cause would you like to choose and why?</strong><br\/><br\/>I&rsquo;ve chosen The RSPCA Stafford, Wolverhampton &amp; District Branch. Naturally! I&rsquo;m a huge dog lover and animal advocate.<br\/><br\/><strong>We are big fans of the RSPCA and in particular of that regional branch &ndash; and I believe that one of our volunteers has helped them develop a new digital strategy that they will soon be implementing. Based on their current profile however, how would you advise them to further develop their brand?</strong><br\/><br\/>Providing effective branding advice relies on more than a gut scan of someone&rsquo;s logo or website. A good brand consultant would first need to understand their goals, vision and target donors first. However, without that background, at a high level, I&rsquo;d recommend they bring their visual look and feel up to date. It feels very dated, cutesy and cartoonish &ndash; is that what appeals to their ideal donor? It could be. By simply adjusting to a more polished font, donors who are not familiar with their great work already can rest assured that they are professional, good stewards of funds and run an efficient operation.<br\/><br\/>In addition, while this might not be possible for this organization, ideally it would be worth opening a discussion around a possible logo change to something more evocative or emotional. Right now, I hate to say it but gives the impression of a security company: very cold and corporate-like. With cause-related organizations, your visual imagery needs to connect using color, shape and even the right font choice. They could &ldquo;warm up their logo&rdquo; with a better design that more fully communicates their mission &ndash; and appeals to the type of donor they&rsquo;d like to attract.<br\/><br\/>These changes would be easy for a pro-bono designer to do for them, provided they first sit down and really articulate their core value and outline their ideal donor.<br\/><br\/>From a brand messaging standpoint, I&rsquo;d have them think about the three main benefits someone gets from being involved with or helping their organization and how they can back up those benefits &ndash; statistics, innovative programs, number or adoptions done each year, any recognition or press they have received. Right now, the website just asks me to do a lot of things without telling me why I should. Take the &ldquo;customer&rdquo; point of view. Why should I adopt? Why should I adopt from you? Why should I volunteer? What kind of difference can I make? Then I&rsquo;d rewrite the copy to focus more on providing proof points and a compelling reason to get involved. I hope that helps them do even more to help animals!</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\"><a href=\"http://www.red-slice.com\">www.red-slice.com</a></p>"

  "content": "<h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">Top Tips for Digital Marketing</h1><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\"><strong>Guest post by Laura Hampton of Zabisco</strong></p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\"><em>Digital marketing is all about engagement. It&rsquo;s about creating an online profile and showing your personality as a means to interacting with the end user and better appealing to their needs. But how exactly is this achieved? </em></p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">It&rsquo;s one thing to be &lsquo;doing digital marketing&rsquo;, quite another to be making it work for you. Since joining Pimp My Cause, we&rsquo;ve seen charities making the same mistakes again and again. So, following chats with three of the causes on the site - Avert, Upbeat Music and Rainbows, we&rsquo;ve put together our top tips for digital marketing success:</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\"><strong>1. The Website</strong></p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">The first step to digital marketing success is to have a well-planned and well-executed online profile. This means making sure your website is up to scratch.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">Your website is your online representation and it should represent you in the best way possible. Whether you have a website already or if you&rsquo;re just starting out in the online world, it&rsquo;s important to think about what your charity is trying to achieve through the website and what information you want to get across to potential audiences.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">A large part of this communication is in your design, branding and tone of voice. Keep this consistent with input and guidance from your branding team or, if you don&rsquo;t have a branding team, create the documentation yourself. This will help you focus your aims and also give you something to refer to if/when you employ an agency to create your website or any other materials for you. You will also need to refer back to your branding and tone of voice to guide your social media and PR efforts.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\"><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/upbeat_resize.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\"><em><a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/34\" target=\"_blank\">Upbeat Music</a> lacked clarity in their brand and their website looked out-dated and difficult to read. The user experience could be improved by rethinking the design and updating the page titles.</em></p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\"><em><br\/></em></p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">Another huge consideration is user experience, as this will say a lot about your brand too. How do you present your request for donation and how does that process work? How easy is it for the user to find what they need? What accessibility options, if any, do you have in place?</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\"><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/avert_resize_2.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\"><em>Avert was lacking clarity in their message and their website was confusing. They needed to rethink what was important and how best to structure the content and navigation around that. </em></p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\"><em><br\/></em></p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">You can then keep your website relevant and up to date with regular new content &ndash; perhaps consider adding a blog to your site to keep visitors up to date with what you&rsquo;re up to, or a more formal news feed which will also be useful for the press. You could also link to your social media, so your audience can see all the places you&rsquo;re active on the web.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">By investing the time and money in your website, you can ensure your brand is understood as you want it to be.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\"><strong>2. The Social Media</strong></p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">Of the causes we spoke to, all were already using social media. The problem was regularity.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">It&rsquo;s a common mistake that charities (and other businesses) make; they attempt to be active in a wide range of social media and, in doing so, are properly active in none. But, as we all know, it can be tough to find the time or the resource to invest in digital marketing.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">To make the most of your time, first consider where your audiences are already active. It may be that your typical user is a fan of Facebook, in which case you&rsquo;d want to be active on Facebook too. Alternatively, Twitter may be their network of choice and, in the same way, you&rsquo;d want to be active on Twitter too.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">By identifying where your audiences are already active, you can target your activity to those areas, putting the effort in when it counts and not spreading yourself too thinly.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\"><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/rainbows_resize.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\"><em><a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/32\" target=\"_blank\">Rainbows</a> had profiles on various social networks, but lacked consistency and regularity in all of them.</em></p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\"><em><br\/></em></p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">Again, refer back to your branding and tone of voice guidelines. Be clear on what you&rsquo;re trying to say and how you will say it, as well as how it will benefit your audience and your organisation, and use that understanding to inform the work you do. By keeping branding and tone of voice consistent, your social media activity becomes the voice of your organisation and takes on a personality with which people can engage and empathise.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\"><strong>3. The Online PR and Link Building</strong></p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">Don&rsquo;t expect your audience to find out about you and what you&rsquo;re up to without any work from you. It&rsquo;s up to you to maintain and build on your online reputation &ndash; both for your audiences and for search engine optimisation purposes.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">The best place to start with online PR is to start writing a blog. As mentioned previously, you can add this into your website and it will give your audience and media the chance to stay up to date with your activity. And it doesn&rsquo;t need to be taxing or formal; so long as you are regularly sharing your news, you&rsquo;ll build up engagement and increase traffic to your site.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">Through your blog, media contacts may decide to get in touch with you, so you may wish to highlight newsworthy stories and ensure your contact details are clear on all of your posts.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">The next step is to start taking that content directly to relevant media contacts. This include relevant trade magazines and websites (consider sites like CharityComms, Third Sector and Charity Times), as well as influential bloggers and social media brands who might be able to help you raise your profile. Identify those sources which are relevant to you and tell them about your news.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">When a piece of news is featured, be sure to include a link back to your website. This will send more traffic your way and also increase your prominence in search engine results pages. And it doesn&rsquo;t stop there - make the most of the feature by sharing it through your social networks and on your site so your audience can see that you&rsquo;re out there spreading your message.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">View <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/professionals/more_information/201\" target=\"_blank\">Zabisco&rsquo;s profile</a> or take a look at the <a href=\"http://www.zabisco.com/blog/\" target=\"_blank\">Zabisco blog</a> for more advice on making the most of your digital efforts.</p>"

You have also been one of my biggest influences in marketing &ndash; I first came across your books when I was just about to move on from my days in brand development at L&rsquo;Oreal and I remember thinking that if my bosses had been as smart as you, I&rsquo;d have stayed. Fortunately I did move on and ended up collaborating with you on a variety of initiatives that have really opened my eyes to new methods of innovation.</strong><br\/><br\/><strong>So first of all John, what led you to write your recent book &ldquo;Co-Opportunity&rdquo;?</strong><br\/><br\/>John Grant: It was a book about a pattern; a shift from individual solutions to co-operative ones, in the fields of sustainability and behaviour change in particular. In the sustainability campaigning arena it was a shift from &ldquo;plastic badges and pledges&rdquo; to social networks for social good; for instance Kiva, Just Giving, Tweet Congress and so on. The pattern itself is a hybrid &ndash; the local involvement of a village style community connected into a global network of efficiency; at both scales you see co-operation but it is not as simple as &ldquo;helping each other&rdquo; it&rsquo;s the configuration itself that is helpful, if for instance you want to club together or avoid individual waste. You can see this pattern much more broadly than in marketing and campaigns; for instance in resource use (smart grids and cloud computing); in social production (Creative Commons) and above all in Economics (Microcredit, Crowd funding, Mutualisation, Community Currencies and Collaborative Consumption).<br\/><br\/><strong>What are the key benefits that you believe accrue to organizations that make this shift and put co-operation at the heart of their strategy?</strong><br\/><br\/>They become more human on the local scale, and more purposeful at the global scale. Co-operation incidentally is defined in systems theory as when individual agents work for the common good, rather than individual goals. Hence the vision thing is vital to co-operating organisations. As is apparent when for instance you look at the manifestos of the original Co-operative Societies like Rochdale in the 19th centuries. Co-operation also potentially unleashes step changes in innovation and efficiencies. So what&rsquo;s not to like, really?<br\/><br\/><strong>It&rsquo;s interesting that you raise the subject of scale. Many of our member causes look to large, powerful corporates and wish that they had the same marketing muscle &ndash; but do you believe the changes that have taken place in marketing and communications over recent years give small organisations with a strong purpose more opportunities than ever before to make a difference disproportionate to their size?</strong><br\/><br\/>Corporates do undoubtedly have enormous marketing budgets. But these are still relatively tiny in a world where attention is a precious and rare commodity. I for instance chose to totally ignore the royal wedding, despite its overwhelming share of broadcast media &ndash; fairly successfully I would add. The mega corporate charities have become like great big threshing machines, driven by direct response numbers and targets, and there is definitely opportunity for new players to become iconic quickly if they can take an early position with any new platform or technology. I&rsquo;m dancing around your question though because my experience is not necessarily that it is &ldquo;easier&rdquo; for small players to have a real impact in that great DIY, entrepreneurial way. Some do but millions of others don&rsquo;t. There is still luck and brilliance required. And it&rsquo;s easier to launch a new shoe still if you are Nike.<br\/><br\/>The lesson I would actually draw from corporates is their founding myths and mentality. Nike was co-founded by the sports coach (Bill Bowerman) who invented jogging. Similar stories are common to most things that go from thousands, to millions, to billions. They have a distinctive point of view on the future of their industry and more importantly the culture and society they contribute to. It&rsquo;s not easy at that hand to mouth stage (Anita Roddick started with one shop in Brighton, the joke about the name being that it was next door to a funeral parlour! But boy did she have a vision). Few people have that in them, they genuinely &ldquo;want to start a nice cause&rdquo; or &ldquo;run a cool clothing shop&rdquo;.<br\/><br\/><strong>So for the world-changers who want to number themselves among those who do really achieve</strong><strong> something special, what are the best ways for them to manage smaller charities and social</strong><strong> enterprises to make sure they take maximum advantage of the new marketing landscape?</strong><br\/><br\/>I would advise them to take the Pimp My Cause approach, naturally: ie don&rsquo;t try to come up with your own new marketing ideas but form relationships with creative marketing people who are up with what&rsquo;s emerging and are capable of doing it really well. Anyone&rsquo;s niece from design college can make a website. But it takes a bit of experience and flair to make the next webby award winner. Especially if there is little money, but just a really good cause or story. You&rsquo;d maybe be surprised<br\/>how motivating it is for some people on the other side of the fence to find a good outlet for their talents and pet ideas (in both senses of the word good).<br\/><br\/><strong>Speaking of which, as always we&rsquo;ve asked you to choose one of the causes on Pimp My Cause to support with some of your ideation skills. So who have you chosen and why?</strong><br\/><br\/>I like UPBEAT. I like the fact its working with those affected by mental illness and that it&rsquo;s about music; two themes close to my heart (as a past voluntary counsellor and having a little music studio). I also liked them being based in Camden, somewhere I lived for many years and I still live close by.<br\/><br\/><strong>And What ideas would you suggest for them?</strong><br\/><br\/>We met up and a lot of it was very practical stuff, like helping them with some other contacts in other venues, the music management forum, new social ventures, media production.<br\/><br\/>I did have some ideas but I&rsquo;m not sure yet how well they would fit, so just for illustration&hellip;<br\/><br\/>I&rsquo;d have thought the most obvious thing for them to do is star in their own a TV documentary. What they do (in Hollywood pitch terms) is &lsquo;Pop Idol meets One Flew Over the Cuckoo&rsquo;s Nest&rsquo;. Only in a good way. They take people who have broken down and help them build themselves back up. I can&rsquo;t think of anything better to watch; it would beat The Apprentice or various Stage School reality docs hands down. Seriously though could have huge benefits in de-stigmatising mental illness, could raise their profile, attract partners to expand their network UK wide. It would also show the healing power of music and performance rather than its destructive sides (Susan Boyle was a case in point)?<br\/><br\/>Given the prevalence of mental health issues in the music industry I&rsquo;d have thought there must be an angle there; a natural way for the music industry and individuals who made their individual name and wealth in it to put something back. If you got some of these names involved all sorts of opportunities would open up; like benefit albums and events. They do have Coldplay as trustees so it&rsquo;s not exactly virgin territory but they really don&rsquo;t need a mass marketing campaign when they<br\/>could fund themselves through 10 names in the music industry writing out some cheques. First thing to do there would probably be to hold an event where they network with fiends of friends&hellip;?<br\/><br\/><strong>We heard last week how excited the Upbeat crew was to move forwards with your ideas, so that is definitely a space to watch closely.</strong><br\/><br\/><strong>So finally, I understand you have largely moved on from consultancy to social entrepreneurship yourself &ndash; what can you tell us about your new venture?</strong><br\/><br\/>My social venture is called Ecoinomy. What we do is get employees to club together and save for their favourite community causes: and this is funded out of savings the employees make in energy, waste, travel etc. We achieve this through a simple to use, engaging, social internet platform. We already have a number of larger corporates signed up, including Scottish &amp; Southern Energy. And we have just launched our simplified and affordable version for smaller organisations. And we have picked up our first client for this too (a financial services company with 60 employees spread across three sites). In terms of pumping up our cause (I would hesitate to use the word &lsquo;pimp&rsquo; in this particular context!) Deborah Meaden from Dragons&rsquo; Den has joined us as an investor and as our chairman.</p><p>For more information about John's new venture go to <a href=\"http://www.ecoinomy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.ecoinomy.com/</a> or read the press release <a href=\"http://www.ecoinomy.com/node/67\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>"

  "content": "<h2>Making the most of Social Media</h2><p>Guest post by Laura Hampton of Zabisco</p><p><br\/><em>Social media is all about engaging with the target audience and creating an online profile for your charity. In this blog, we take a look at some examples from Pimp My Cause and give our advice on making the most of social media.</em><br\/><br\/>With resource and budget a key concern for many of the causes on Pimp My Cause, it&rsquo;s not surprise to see requests for social media <em>on a shoestring</em>.<br\/><br\/>But budget social media does not mean ineffective social media. The real value of social media marketing is in the doors it opens for interaction and engagement with your end user. It&rsquo;s about creating the opportunities to have conversations with your customers so you can better understand them and they can let you know how they feel. It helps us as businesses to better tailor our services to the needs and motivations of our target audience.<br\/><br\/>One way to think of your social media campaign is as a <em>dinner party</em>. Be the &lsquo;host with the most&rsquo; and your users are sure to come back for more.<br\/><br\/><strong>1. Know your guests</strong><br\/><br\/>If you want to engage with your target audience, it&rsquo;s important to understand who they are and what they are interested in &ndash; and what you have to offer that will appeal to these needs. This should be the basis of your &lsquo;dinner party&rsquo; plans and will guide the rest of your decisions.<br\/><br\/>For <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/39\" target=\"_blank\">Garden Organic</a>, the vast amount of information they have to offer on their site is by no means a disadvantage. What is holding them back, however, is the lack of clear <em>messaging</em> &ndash; and this is because the organic growing organisation appears to lack <em>audience</em> focus.<br\/><br\/>This is apparent from their current use of social media. The charity is using a wide range of media, including Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Flickr, but no one of these media has a clear strategy. Instead, <em>Garden Organic</em> broadcasts messages and updates, lacking in any real engagement because there is no defined reason to interact.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/garden_organic_social_media.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p><p><em>Garden Organic&rsquo;s social media activity</em></p><p><em>Garden Organic</em>, and other charities, can improve their audience targeting by gaining a better understanding of who they are trying to target and how best to do so. They can then invest their time and money into these areas.<br\/><br\/><strong>2. Consider the party location</strong><br\/><br\/>If all your friends lived in Edinburgh, you wouldn&rsquo;t hold a party for them in London because it would make it really difficult for them to attend. In the same way, you should engage in social media where your audience is already active &ndash; bringing the party to them and making it easy for them to attend and get involved.<br\/><br\/>As an example, consider where <em>Garden Organic&rsquo;s</em> audience would be active. This audience may benefit from a mobile presence; they are, after all, gardening and are therefore less likely to be by their computers when they need advice. A mobile app which gives them quick and easy access to organic gardening advice could be a great way for <em>Garden Organic</em> to raise their profile and encourage organic gardening.<br\/><br\/><strong>3. Meet the dietary needs</strong><br\/><br\/>Just as you wouldn&rsquo;t serve meat to a vegetarian, you want to be sure that what you say and offer on social media is actually attractive and useful to the audience you wish to engage.<br\/><br\/>A cause which may benefit from more targeting would be <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/29\" target=\"_blank\">Feed the Hungry UK</a>. As they attempt to spread their campaign &ldquo;Take Away Hunger&rdquo;, what might their audience be looking for? This type of campaign lends itself to targets and updates as the audience follows what their contribution is doing and how much food is being provided, as well as seeing the effect the food is having through videos, blogs and photos. So how about creating a Facebook page where people can follow the campaign?</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/feed_the_hungry_home.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><br\/><em>Feed the Hungry UK has the website but could benefit with web pages and social media solely dedicated to the Take Away Hunger campaign.</em><br\/><br\/>Facebook also works well for charities because the audience typically wants to be seen to be helping. Creating a Page that people can <em>like</em> allows them to say to their friends &ldquo;look, I&rsquo;m helping&rdquo;.<br\/><br\/>(An important point to remember when using Facebook is that you must set up a Page for your organisation and not a personal profile as any organisation found to be using a personal profile will be banned).<br\/><br\/>Whatever medium you use, think &lsquo;what does my audience want?&rsquo; and &lsquo;how can I provide it to them in the most engaging way?&rsquo;.<br\/><br\/><strong>4. Be a good host</strong><br\/><br\/>You&rsquo;re the host of your party so you need to make sure your guests are comfortable and having a good time. Guide the conversation but don&rsquo;t talk at them &ndash; your party is about conversation and everyone should be able to get involved.<br\/><br\/>That means listening as well as broadcasting. So join in with conversations on social networks outside of your own pages and groups to find out what your audience is talking about and how can you get involved.<br\/><br\/>An example of this can be found in <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/10\" target=\"_blank\">Basic Needs</a>. With little activity on social networks, they rely solely on their website to promote their cause. But, with so much information on their website, it&rsquo;s difficult to see what the key messages are and what the intent on the site is &ndash; they are, essentially, simply broadcasting information and not really accounting for what the audience wants.<br\/><br\/>This could be improved upon with a reduction in text on the site and a more refined and restructured navigation and page layout, drawing audiences to the most important points. The vast amount of information they have on the site could work very well around social networks or in Wiki style pages.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/basic_needs_home2.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><br\/><br\/><em>Basic Needs would benefit from a content restructuring and more clarity of key messages, which can then be spread through social networks.</em><br\/><br\/><strong>5. Keep in touch after the party</strong><br\/><br\/>Be available to your audience beyond your social media interaction &ndash; ensure there are ways for people to get in touch and find out more via your website.<br\/><br\/>Consider email marketing campaigns. They can be set up really easily via clients such as Mailchimp and can be a great way of keeping in touch with your audience and the media. Use it to promote your latest news and let people know what you&rsquo;re up to and what effect their donations are having.<br\/><br\/>Also think about the sharing potential of your content. If it&rsquo;s of a high quality and genuinely useful to your audience, they may choose to share it with their friends and contacts. So make social share easy by including things like &lsquo;tweet&rsquo; and &lsquo;like&rsquo; buttons on your site and your email campaigns.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/social_share.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><br\/><em>There are plenty of social share buttons to choose from and these can easily be added to your website.</em><br\/><br\/>Don&rsquo;t just jump on the social media band wagon because &lsquo;everyone else is&rsquo; &ndash; make sure you&rsquo;re making the most of your time and your investment. Treat your social media like a dinner party &ndash; keep your guests happy and provide them information of quality and value and you&rsquo;ll find your efforts go a lot further than you&rsquo;d expect.<br\/><br\/>For more information on making the most of your digital efforts, take a look at the <a href=\"http://www.zabisco.com/blog/\" target=\"_blank\">Zabisco blog</a> or contact <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/professionals/more_information/201\" target=\"_blank\">Zabisco via Pimp My Cause</a>.</p>"

You co-wrote the books &ldquo;Understanding Digital Marketing&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Best Digital Marketing Campaigns in the World: Mastering the Art of Public Engagement&rdquo; and are a founding partner of Mediaventura.</strong><br\/><br\/><strong>So to begin, Damian, what would you say have been the key changes in digital marketing since you founded the first digital agency in the UK?</strong><br\/><br\/>Damian Ryan: Firstly I should confirm that I have no idea if ours was the first digital agency in the UK market, but it was certainly the first to be based in Ireland where our first series of campaigns were for UK and American clients. Thought I better state that before I get a barrage of emails from other &ldquo;net vets&rdquo;!<br\/><br\/>Key Changes?<br\/><br\/>I feel the first ten years of digital marketing were symbolized by the replication of traditional marketing models on new media. Classifieds became banners, directories became search and direct mail became email. Now it&rsquo;s swung right around to a growing focus on &ldquo;engagement&rdquo; and I see marketers now treating people like, well, people!!<br\/><br\/>The lessons learned by digital marketers are now starting to be seen on traditional media &ndash; the poacher has turned gamekeeper. That&rsquo;s been the key change.<br\/><br\/><strong>Yes it&rsquo;s been a fascinating transition whereby a technology - the internet - has actually allowed us to</strong><strong> be far more human in the way we interact.</strong><br\/><br\/><strong>What led you to write your book on the Best Campaigns in the world?</strong><br\/><br\/>Feedback from readers who wanted to see more case studies &ndash; it was as simple as that really.<br\/><br\/>There wasn't that much writing involved &ndash; we (Calvin Jones and I) had the benefit of a researcher based in Amsterdam (Eva McLaughlin) who helped us gather the material and we put it together from there. We hope it will form the beginning of a discussion and a true engagement among digital marketers who can really decide for themselves what represents &ldquo;the best&rdquo; &ndash; all we&rsquo;ve done is kick off the chatter!<br\/><br\/><strong>And if you had to pick one campaign from the book as your own personal favourite, which would it be, and what lessons could a charity or social venture draw from that campaign?</strong><br\/><br\/>The Queensland Tourist Board&rsquo;s &ldquo;Best Job in the world&rdquo; campaign was my favourite. It showed an extraordinary level of bravery to shoot for the stars! There&rsquo;s your lesson right there &ndash; be brave!!!<br\/><br\/><strong>Yes that was a marvelously creative promotion and probably the best tourism campaign of any type in history. People can see a link to the campaign creative <a href=\"http://www.islandfreejob.com.au/about-the-best-job\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</strong><br\/><br\/><strong>One of the points of real interest for me reading your book on the best campaigns in the world was that while some of the campaigns featured have several hundred thousand dollar budgets, some of them needed very little investment, and one of them, the campaign to make Rage Against The Machine the Christmas Number one, had no budget at all. At Pimp My Cause we believe digital marketing is a real opportunity for causes that may have little money to spend but a really interesting story to tell &ndash; what advice would you give to groups who need to get a lot of impact from digital without spending much money?</strong><br\/><br\/>Appeal to people&rsquo;s sense of goodwill and generosity. The great promise of the Internet is spookily similar to that of the telegraph 130 years ago &ndash; some felt that if the world could get on the same page then it would promote the concept of a harmonious society. Hmm, that didn't really work did it!?<br\/><br\/>However the Internet has provided society with the ideal platform to save lives, do good and bring like minded people together in an instant and engaging way &ndash; I would add that most of the guys who work in digital marketing are very quick to get involved and help out in projects especially if it connects them with like minded people around the world. Ask them and you&rsquo;ll find out!<br\/><br\/>We are hoping to launch something ourselves in the near future, we are currently in discussions with some of the larger Internet companies and colleges so watch this space!!<br\/><br\/><strong>Sounds like you have an intriguing new initiative on the way and we&rsquo;ll look forward to hearing more about it in due course. In the meantime, which causes would you like to pick to advise from among our members and what would you suggest they do to improve their digital marketing?</strong><br\/><br\/>European Disaster Volunteers (EDV). I suggest they recruit a panel from the local digital media market. Leaders from the agencies and suppliers &ndash; challenge them to raise the bar. If they do this I will give a free copy of the book to the first ten who join this panel.<br\/><br\/><strong>Great stuff &ndash; we&rsquo;ll definitely advise our marketers to step up to that plate!</strong><br\/><br\/><strong>Before you go, could you tell us about your latest venture Mediaventura and the activities you get involved with there?</strong><br\/><br\/>It&rsquo;s only been a year since we established the business and it has been a great success. We are now working with some of the smartest people in the business and on some really cool assignments. We are now realizing that people hire us because we have a unique entrepreneurial spirit and are very focused on working hard, being transparent and demonstrating that corporate finance is not the complicated and intimidating business it used to be. Our main activities are devising investment strategies for digital media brands but also raising that investment and realizing value and ROI for shareholders. Nothing gives us more of a thrill than seeing the results of our work &ndash; it can be life changing at times but it&rsquo;s certainly high octane, emotional and extremely good fun too! I&rsquo;m a very lucky man. I am doing the job I always wanted to do with people that inspire me.<br\/><br\/><strong>Damian, many thanks for this, and thanks also for agreeing to become our Ambassador of Digital Marketing. We&rsquo;ll look forward to some great collaboration ahead!</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.mediaventura.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.mediaventura.com</a></p>"

We estimate that our programmes support about 750, 000 young people in the UK each year.<br\/><br\/>But because our funding has historically come from the public purse, we have always focused our efforts on service delivery rather than marketing, so have rather passed under the radar when it comes to public awareness.<br\/><br\/>In the current climate government funding is clearly dwindling. We are therefore acutely aware of the need to promote our activity more than in the past and appeal to potential new backers and supporters. These will either be members of the public or corporate supporters.<br\/><br\/>Marketing and branding can be very costly so having the support from experts in the Pimp My Cause stable is a god-send.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/ukyouth.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/><br\/>Paul has assembled an expert team who have shown that they have highly relevant expertise and have been willing to commit to significant time helping us. This has included himself, and two past candidates from the BBC&rsquo;s Apprentice, Alex Espstein who runs a brand storytelling consultancy, and Melody Hossaini who runs the youth development social enterprise InspirEngage International Ltd.<br\/><br\/>Their insights have already been spot-on when diagnosing our challenges and how we can deal with this.<br\/><br\/>Internally we had already begun looking at our public image &ndash; brand, website, PR activity &ndash; and had become a little daunted about the associated costs of a radical overhaul.<br\/><br\/>But during the course of our series of workshops together, Paul, Alex and Melody have helped us to develop a marketing strategy based less on investing in &ldquo;image&rdquo; and more on harnessing the power of our network.<br\/><br\/>What the PMC team has helped us understand is that there is currently an opportunity to leapfrog costly linear PR &amp; brand-building. They have advised us to move towards a participatory model that will allow UK Youth to generate interest through the use of social media and by developing participatory initiatives or &lsquo;platforms&rsquo; that will allow us to engage many more people in actively helping us achieve our mission.<br\/><br\/>Examples of ideas we have discussed include:</p><ul><li>&ldquo;The Open Generation&rdquo;: the name here refers both to a new name for the first generation of young people to grow up with the open, collaborative tools of the internet available to them throughout their whole lives and literally the open generation of ideas and initiatives &ndash; the Open Generation would be a participative platform within the UK Youth website dedicated to enabling our volunteers and the young people we support to co-create and co-design our future initiatives with us.</li><li>The &ldquo;Futurepreneurs&rdquo; &ndash; a project to support young people in achieving independence by turning their passions and interests into businesses.</li><li>&ldquo;Pass the Baton&rdquo;: a co-created report on intergenerational equity and what we can do now to ensure that young people do not inherit the consequences of our bad decisions.</li><li>Creating social media champions to stimulate participation among our audiences.</li><li>Creating opportunities for young people to become &lsquo;leaders&rsquo; for a day/week.</li></ul><p>We have been busy re-launching our website &ndash; <a href=\"http://www.ukyouth.org\">www.ukyouth.org</a> &ndash; which as our Pimp My Cause discussions suggested now encourages much more participation from partners and our wider audience.<br\/><br\/>We are looking to begin &lsquo;activating&rsquo; some of the Pimp My Cause suggestions and benefitting further from the invaluable support of Paul, Alex &amp; Melody.<br\/><br\/>Pimp My Cause is giving us the confidence to develop a marketing and PR plan that will promote our work in an innovative and cost effective way.</p>"

  "content": "<h2>A Conversation with aladin, Strategic Counsel to the Big Society and former Chair of the Cultural Strategy Group for London, one of the most influential figures in civil society in the UK in the past decade</h2><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/aladinweb.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p><p><strong>Paul Skinner: aladin, for the benefit of any readers who don&rsquo;t know you, you have a wide-ranging career that defies all attempts at summary &ndash; including everything from international diplomacy to performing magic illusions. You are strategic counsel to the Big Society, consult widely on civil society initiatives globally, were Chair of the Cultural Strategy Group for London for Mayor Livingstone and in charge of creating the first integrated cultural strategy for any capital city and have been a key figure in the voluntary sector in the UK for more than 15 years. You are also part of the Pimp My Cause team and have been helping us move our whole project forwards.</strong><br\/><br\/><strong>What would you say are the main differences between the challenges you faced as Chair of the Cultural Strategy Group for London in 2000-4 under Ken Livingstone when he was Mayor of London, and the challenges you face now through your work with the Big Society, and how has the agenda for civil society moved forwards in that time?</strong><br\/><br\/>aladin: Ken Livingstone and David Cameron each share very similar commitment to and confidence in the strength, depth and resilience of our civil society to be able to propose solutions and strategies which reflect its core values and principles. Both London&rsquo;s Culture Plan and The Big Society mirror their patrons&rsquo; passion about harnessing the ability of citizens themselves to be able to map and build civic processes and projects in ways which fit their needs and aspirations.<br\/><br\/>The sheer diversity, heterodoxy and heterogeneity of London&rsquo;s culture, media, sport, arts, heritage and tourism demanded a cultural strategy which derived from an iterative &lsquo;consultation&rsquo; and mapping process led by stakeholders, leading to a well resourced action plan. The resourcing can be inferred from our successful Olympic bid and our radical work in supporting and representing in our &lsquo;brand&rsquo; the artistic and cultural diversity for which London is renowned and in setting new benchmarks for &lsquo;sustainability&rsquo;.<br\/><br\/>David Cameron&rsquo;s conception of The Big Society is no less compelling than Livingstone&rsquo;s heartfelt belief and trust in Londoners as a source of positive ideas and ultimately as a force for good. Each explicitly believes in empowering the communities which make up our society to be allowed to describe the world that they want and be given the ability to make or at least influence the decisions to make this real.<br\/><br\/>The difference a decade on from the start of my work at City Hall is that the Prime Minister of the day is operating under economic constraints that were frankly unimaginable at the time I was appointed by Ken Livingstone. Thus we have to be smarter than ever before to ignite and catalyse new ways of bringing assets to back the visions and priorities of our citizens &ndash; adding value to the critical projects and processes of our times.<br\/><br\/>Whereas between 2000-4 we seemed to have no limit to the number of partners willing to back the radical ideas springing out of the cultural strategy for London, 2010&rsquo;s accession of David Cameron to Number 10 brought into relief a very different picture because of the impact of the recession on the status of established, conventional ways to nourish good work.<br\/><br\/>The new civic economy requires that we back (social) enterprise, ingenuity, innovation, interdisciplinarity and GENIUS in additional ways than solely cash to in turn support, seed, inculcate the empowerment and building of communities.<br\/><br\/>It&rsquo;s a privilege to be able to have the opportunity to make a democratic, non-partisan contribution to help bring to reality two such profound, radical civic projects,<br\/><br\/>Pimp My Cause of course embodies a conception of a society whose constituent elements join together to add value to each other&rsquo;s processes &ndash; &lsquo;because it is right&rsquo;.</p><p><strong>Thanks for your support of Pimp My Cause. And yes, many of our causes feel for themselves the challenge of adapting to such a challenging economic environment just as the social and environmental issues they address are so acute. They also need to be relentlessly positive to succeed at such a difficult time &ndash; so despite the difficulties, what would you say are the key opportunities that charities and social enterprises can still grasp at this difficult time?</strong><br\/><br\/>Where we can with conviction and convincement coalesce and collaborate around initiatives which have the backing of the government of the day we have a good chance of succeeding in our endeavours. There is also a backdrop of an increasing focus and pressure globally for processes to demonstrate that they inherently contribute what I call &lsquo;civic gain&rsquo; or &lsquo;civil yield&rsquo;. Charities and social enterprises have always been at the vanguard of delivering the latter &ndash; they should grasp the historic opportunity to participate in creating a better template for society to engage with each other, to knowledge share and to help us to chart the way forward.</p><p><strong>So charities and social ventures have a great opportunity to influence the future. That has to be a positive thing.</strong><br\/><br\/><strong>Turning back to you, of course there are many other aspects to your work from re-structuring developing countries' debt to an iconic, word-of-mouth, underground status as one of the world's greatest magicians. One of the most intriguing things about your career is that you are very difficult to categorize &ndash; how important do you feel it is to work across boundaries in the voluntary sector?</strong><br\/><br\/>I have never set out to eschew boundaries or categories. Temperamentally I have always been an explorer emotionally and intellectually so I was always unconsciously travelling across other people&rsquo;s, including society&rsquo;s, boundaries. It helped me to have perspective on whatever I was engaging with and also instilled an instinct for seeing things for what they are as opposed to what they are supposed to be. While this can be uncomfortable it is also necessary &ndash; I had rather been on the winning side of history than stick around with those lumbered with ideology, &lsquo;expertise&rsquo; and affiliations to one practice or another.<br\/><br\/>Innovation cannot come through being risk averse and avoiding new experiences; we have to be willing to collide with barriers and occasionally career through them; we&rsquo;ll learn from our scratches and bruises at the very least. Charities should not feel they have to behave according to type; they must at all costs avoid ending up in a silo.<br\/><br\/><strong>Absolutely. One of our key objectives at Pimp My Cause is to escape silos by bringing together causes and marketers, most of whom are not from the voluntary sector, for the benefit of both sides.</strong><br\/><br\/><strong>And speaking of which, we have come to the point in the conversation where we ask you to choose one or two causes from among our members to give some advice to &ndash; and in your cause I believe you have already started collaborating with your chosen causes?</strong><br\/><br\/>Yes that&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;ve chosen <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/400\">ASTI the Acid Survivors Trust International</a> and Entelechy Arts. They work in quite different ways to each other but are both profoundly effective at re-establishing and sustaining the core processes of civil society. ASTI developed its work initially in Bangladesh while Entelechy has piloted an approach over decades in the Deptford area of London; the success of both projects has led to the development and application of their methodologies further afield. ASTl is based in the UK but its project work is now across continents; Entelechy is now active across London, the UK and is into its second year establishing peer relationships with Brazilian counterparts.<br\/><br\/>Something else which joins ASTI and Entelechy are that each focuses on the human rights of highly marginalised individuals and groups - the kind of people that society finds very problematic meeting its responsibilities towards, preferring that their presence and needs were kept hidden, swept under the carpet even.<br\/><br\/>I am partly of Bangladeshi ancestry and earlier this year with my hat as Emeritus Editor of one of Bangladesh's main media groups I chose to report on the work of ASTI to combat acid violence in that country. A horrific phenomenon which has required exceptional advocacy and vision to tackle; they are turning the corner quite remarkably. I am now looking to give<br\/>ASTI a boost in their overall marketing communications strategy by recruiting marketeers. PR specialists and others to support them in their profile and fundraising.<br\/><br\/>I've been supporting Entelechy Arts since about 1990 and was Chair of their board of trustees for the best part of two decades. I have focused on their strategic planning and brokered partnerships to enable them to continue developing their practice. Having relinquished formal ties to them a few years back I am now looking to bring in marketing communications assets via Pimp My Cause as they have suddenly broken through a perception glass ceiling nationally and are much in demand - but need to know how to make marketing capital out of this.<br\/><br\/><strong>And what advice do you have for them?</strong><br\/><br\/>They each have to persist using their instincts to develop their professional practice: they are for good reason best in class worldwide. At the same time they must avail themselves of every particle of advice and elbow grease to make the most of their exceptionally high level of credibility in their fields. So it is time for them to work hand in hand with communications specialists who are as exceptional as they are.<br\/><br\/>More specifically each needs to quite speedily derive and implement a communications strategy with the support of assets through Pimp My Cause with a view to being able to<br\/><br\/>secure further funding partnerships, cement their brand positioning and get up to speed internally on the communications front. This later relates both to methodology and staffing assets.<br\/><br\/>ASTI and Entelechy in my view would benefit from some outstanding branding narrative work which overcomes the issue to do with the fact that many of the individuals and communities they are partnering with are shunned by wider society. What is the issue at the heart of their work which can be put across in a way which creates engagement in a fresh, uplifting way and utterly wins over any and all who come across their work? My own instinct is that they need to make more of the fact that their work makes civil society thrive, become more resilient, fair and prosperous in the true meaning of the word.<br\/><br\/><strong>That is fascinating. And of course if any marketers reading this would like to join you in advising these two great causes, they can mail me at paul@pimpmycause.org and I&rsquo;ll be delighted to make the introductions.</strong></p>"

Most recently as VP at Method Products, the innovative home care brand, and previously leading brands at Nestle and General Mills.</strong><br\/><br\/><strong>And on a personal note I recently listened to you speak in Soho, London and your talk just made me want to go out and create &ndash; and was therefore probably the most worthwhile thing I&rsquo;ve listened to all year!</strong><br\/><br\/><strong>Tom, before we get on to your cartoons, we&rsquo;ve heard a lot about your experiences as VP of marketing for the iconic cleaning brand Method and loved the mission: &ldquo;People against dirty!&rdquo;. Could you tell us a little about how that mission shaped a participatory approach to your marketing and what charities and social ventures can take from that experience and apply in their own context?</strong><br\/><br\/>Tom Fishburne: On every method bottle, you&rsquo;ll find the statement, &ldquo;made by and for people against dirty&rdquo;. &ldquo;Dirty&rdquo; is a much more powerful sentiment than simply a clean home. And that mission not only drove the Method team, it inspired the consumers who followed us.<br\/><br\/>There&rsquo;s a quote from Simon Sinek I like that &ldquo;people don&rsquo;t buy what you make. They buy why you make it&rdquo;. There has never been a greater time for purpose-driven organizations. There is a shift happening in marketing from brand promise to brand purpose. Yet, if you talk to many businesses about purpose, they think about the stale mission statements that hang on the wall that don&rsquo;t really inspire anyone (which I enjoy parodying in cartoons).<br\/><br\/>I met recently with an amazing organization called Teach for America that places recent college grads into a two-year teaching assignment at under-privileged urban and rural schools. They shared that it was tough to recruit college grads who were fielding top job offers from consulting firms and blue chip companies. I shared that while they couldn&rsquo;t out-pay those competing organizations, they could out-purpose them. Purpose is the killer app.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/110131.mission.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p><p><strong>Paul: Fascinating stuff Tom. And from the perspective of Pimp My Cause I&rsquo;d have to agree &ndash; the only reason we are able to achieve what we do is because our members share our purpose. That is certainly our &ldquo;killer app&rdquo; &ndash; and the kind of motivation that you have encouraged Teach America to tap into is exactly the well from which many of our causes need to draw to achieve their goals as well.</strong><br\/><br\/><strong>I love the Mission Statement cartoon &ndash; and speaking of which, of all the &ldquo;marketoons&rdquo; you have created, could you show us your favourite and tell us the story behind it?</strong></p><p><strong><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/071008.garden.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></strong></p><p>Tom: Any idea worth launching into the world will face obstacles, set backs, and idea killers. Sometimes those challenges will sand away the essence of the idea until there is nothing left. It&rsquo;s easier to critique than to create. Yet, I admire those who plant ideas even against the odds, and through passion and perseverance, manage to grow those ideas into something remarkable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Paul: Marvellous! I think one of the features of cartoons that makes them so powerful is their ability to persuade &ndash; what lessons can be drawn out of the way cartoons work that can help people improve their marketing?</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tom: We live in a cluttered world and audiences are no longer captive to a handful of television stations. It is no longer effective to simply out-interrupt each other. There has never been a better time for brands that can tell a story well. Yet, most marketing is not content worth sharing.<br\/><br\/>A good question to ask is whether your audience would tape your marketing communication to their fridge?<br\/><br\/>I think that marketers can learn from cartoons as one of the simplest forms of storytelling. The cartoon caption contest ignited readership in the New Yorker. The most popular cartoon on the web (XKCD) has punchlines you can't understand if you're not a Unix programmer. Cartoons are episodic, simple, interactive, and incredibly powerful with niche audiences. Most importantly, the best cartoons are about the reader, not about the cartoonist. Audiences can easily filter out marketing that simply pitches features and benefits. Today&rsquo;s marketing can&rsquo;t be too self-promotional. It needs to be content worth sharing.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/110418b.storytelling.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p><p><strong>Paul: Well after posting this interview I&rsquo;m off to the fridge to stick that cartoon on the door!</strong><br\/><br\/><strong>But before I do that Tom, at this point in our interviews we ask you to pick out one of our member causes and offer them some high level advice or ideas to help them with their marketing. Who would you like to pick and why?</strong></p><p><strong><br\/></strong></p><p>Tom: There are so many inspiring member causes. I was particularly struck by CreateAbility and their mission to &ldquo;encourage the artist in vulnerable people&rdquo;. I think that we too often forget the artistic ability we all shared as children. All of us have the capacity to create. When you awaken that natural ability as adults, I believe it can inspire confidence and empowerment. I&rsquo;ve started to incorporate drawing workshops into many of the organizations I speak with. It is liberating.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/111003.creativity.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p><p><strong>Paul: That is a great choice Tom. And what advice would you give them?</strong></p><p><strong><br\/></strong></p><p>Tom: I like the idea that the CreateAbility artwork can be be exhibited and sold. I&rsquo;d recommend expanding that idea further. In a marketing context, each piece of artwork is a piece of media. The artwork could be shared, not only in exhibitions, but in social media, PR, and any point of CreateAbility marketing communication. Each piece of artwork is a Trojan Horse that communicates the individual artist as well as CreateAbility as a whole. There is no cause website yet, but I would recommend building one with example artwork at the core and easy social media sharing built right in.<br\/><br\/>I would look at Kickstarter.com as a role model. Kickstarter funds and features creative projects with a similar aim of encouraging the artist. Kickstarter has never had to pay for advertising. Instead, it lets the creative projects they host do all the talking. Every time an artist shares their creative project with the world, it translates to increased awareness for Kickstarter. It&rsquo;s a virtuous circle for all. CreateAbility can take a similar approach.<br\/><br\/>These personal referrals can help create awareness and break through the clutter with the CreateAbility audience.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/050905.wom.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To learn more about Tom visit <a href=\"http://tomfishburne.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://tomfishburne.com/</a>.</p>"

Sarah Wallbank has joined Seye in running Stay Focused and together they plan to tackle the barriers that are in the way of a significant portion or the young community in West London by providing an intensive skill development and professional awareness programme for all young people aged 13-24.<br\/><br\/>Richard Eason, the founder of <a href=\"http://lifethrives.com/about.html\" target=\"_blank\">Life Thrives CIC</a>, proposes to create the Life Thrives Programme app - linking a person's 'profile' to daily activities that could enrich their lives and make them thrive. This would be achieved through personal development opportunities, a time manager, volunteering opportunities, etc.<br\/><br\/>Marco and I were on hand to support the entrepreneurs with marketing advice ahead of their presentations to the Dragons Den. Marco&nbsp;has a breadth of communications, marketing strategy, digital and direct marketing, information design and public relations expertise and&nbsp;I have&nbsp;a professional background in marketing and sales force effectiveness alongside 10 years spent as a volunteer, several as a board member in the UK and&nbsp;a recent appointment&nbsp;to the International Board as an International Ambassador for Variety the Children&rsquo;s Charity.<br\/><br\/>Listening to their concepts, we provided guidance on how to present, how to prioritise concepts, offered advice on determining target audiences and how to approach companies regarding funding and sponsorship.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/5ways.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/><br\/><br\/>For the 5ways webiste looking to showcase creative talents via numerous methods for those with little work experience, success to date included ten individuals&rsquo; having had their work published. In order to fund the ongoing venture the challenge presented was one of attracting advertising revenue to develop the venture and gain donations from companies for prize competitions. Advice offered included defining the overall concept and prioritising the methods and target audience for showcasing various talents, enabling the entrepreneur to define the approach for attracting the most relevant advertisers and to the how to approach companies to gain sponsorship and support for the venture.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/stayfocused.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/><br\/><br\/>For Stay Focused the challenge was to gain funding to build the mentoring element of the programme so that the kids had access to visiting professional working environments and also gained the benefit of guidance and experience of professionals. Advice included how to present the concept, how to approach organisations with a wider remit of not only providing mentors to support the children and access to the organisation for work experience visits but to also gain funding from the corporate supporters to cover the costs of running the mentoring programme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/lifethrives.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/><br\/><br\/>The final concept was for Life Thrives smart phone application to enable individuals to monitor how well they are 'thriving' based on a range of criteria such as their relationships with people, their mental and physical health, giving back to the community thus impacting on claims on insurers in the long term. The challenges included, defining segments within the market that the application would be relevant to, generating partnerships with companies within the wellbeing and insurance sector to promote and drive the utilisation of the application. Advice offered included defining the target market of the end consumer, creating a user friendly application that was fun to use and ideas were given on how to overcome any user dishonesty in terms of the input of information!<br\/><br\/>Working with the entrepreneurs highlighted that there were numerous great ideas and untapped concepts out there for social enterprise. The general themes of the advice offered to all the entrepreneurs was to set a clear objective, create a set of unique selling points defining a target audience both in terms of who you want to engage with and who if different is going to fund the cause. Where there were multiple goals prioritise them to align appropriate strategy, timelines and resource.<br\/><br\/>Fair to say that each entrepreneur had a lot of ideas, drive, energy, passion and willingness to act and make a difference, from my own experience it is a great feeling to be able to support others to make a difference and I would encourage anyone with an idea on how they could improve the lives of others to go for it, it is definitely worth the effort!</p>"

Our clinic and emergency vetline provide access to low-cost veterinary treatment for over 3,000 pets each year, and we also treat and rehome strays who have been picked up injured or ill.<br\/> <br\/> In recent years we have been struggling to raise sufficient funds to keep our activities going and this year we installed a gift aid system in all three of our branch charity shops. This system makes it possible for us to reclaim an extra 25% of the value of every item sold from HMRC provided its original donor pays UK income tax and completed a gift aid form at the time of donation.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/dogsmall.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><br\/> <br\/> We found that getting donors to sign the forms was a barrier to making the system work for several reasons:<br\/> <br\/> Our volunteers were reluctant to appear ungrateful by asking donors to complete an extra chore.<br\/> <br\/> Some donors were confused about what they were being asked to do (for example they sometimes thought they were being asked to sign direct debit forms to make regular money donations).<br\/> <br\/> The generic gift aid posters supplied by the vendors of the gift aid system were not terribly appealing, because they didn't speak to the particular interests of our donors.<br\/> <br\/> We put an advert on Pimp My Cause, asking for help with publicising the gift aid system and <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/professionals/more_information/863\" target=\"_blank\">Mike Freeman</a> responded.<br\/> <br\/> He was extremely helpful, giving us advice on training our volunteers to feel confident about asking donors to sign and also producing three<br\/> posters to be used in our publicity.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/heartsmall.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><br\/> <br\/> These posters are visually very appealing and being in electronic form they can not only be printed out, but also used on our website and facebook page to prime donors to expect to be asked to complete a gift aid form. This aspect is extremely important as Mike pointed out to us that most people automatically say no when asked to sign anything as a self-defence mechanism to avoid endless begging letters.<br\/> <br\/> We particularly like the colourful \"heart\" poster which combines thanks for the actual donation of goods with the request to complete the form.<br\/> <br\/> Prior to our gift aid campaign, the percentage of gift aided sales was varying at around 8-12% and is now consistently around 18-25%.<br\/> <br\/> We don't expect to achieve 100% as not all of our donors are UK tax payers, but we are hopeful that it may be possible to drive the percentage<br\/> up to 50%, which would mean an increase in our income of over &pound;1,000 - enough to cover a week's running costs for our clinic.</p>"

Almost all of our causes are looking to change people&rsquo;s behavior in some purpose-driven way. What would you pick out as your three top tips on behavior change, and what is the best example of behavior change in action you&rsquo;ve seen so far in 2011?</strong></p><p>Ed Gillespie: As we say at Futerra &ndash; behaviour change is a contact sport! You have to be prepared to get stuck in, get your hands dirty, people are complex beasties that must be treated with respect but there are three crucial factors that help generate effective behaviour change:</p><ol><li>Personal factors: changing habits, intervening with the correct incentives, motivations and drivers to influence specific behaviours. Key to this is creating a sense of &lsquo;agency&rsquo;. By this we mean the knowledge of what behaviour change is required, how to execute it and the desire to make this happen. Many of the problems with behaviour change for sustainability stem from creating a sense of fear without agency. This is fundamentally disempowering.</li><li>Social factors: We are communal, communicative animals at heart and what other people are doing around us really matters. There are multiple unconscious, subconscious and intuitive influences that affect our behaviours all the time. We instinctively mirror and echo the behaviour of others &ndash; what psychologists call &lsquo;social proof&rsquo;.</li><li>Infrastructure factors: Is the necessary access, facility or equipment in place to facilitate the behaviour change? How easy or simple is it to carry out?</li></ol><p>These may seem like obvious avenues but when you align all three factors transformative behaviour change is not only possible &ndash; it almost becomes inevitable! My favourite example of recent years is the increase in cycling in London, which has been almost doubling year on year. You can see this is because of an alignment of the factors mentioned above. Personal factors* include saving money, faster travel, personal fitness and style/fashion trends (those East End &lsquo;fixies&rsquo;!), socially the sheer visibility and numbers of cyclists provides a salience and social proof for cycling that makes enormous sense and finally the infrastructure is improving with cycle superhighways, more bike lanes and the City Bike scheme which allows people to &lsquo;experiment&rsquo; with free hire bikes. The combination of these factors leads to a possible culture change and that&rsquo;s to be celebrated. Crucially people will cycle for their own reasons* not necessarily because it&rsquo;s &lsquo;good for the environment&rsquo;. However, once they&rsquo;re on the bike I suspect issues such as urban air quality and use of road space become more relevant and important to them.</p><p><strong>Paul: We&rsquo;ve been reading about your adventures on your year long trip travelling around the world without taking a single flight. Interested readers can discover how you got on <a href=\"http://www.travelblogs.com/interviews/flightless-round-the-world-interview-with-ed-gillespie\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, but could you tell us in what ways that journey may have influenced your work since? Did the outer journey bring about any inner change?</strong></p><p>Ed: Of course circumnavigating the globe without flying has ongoing and lasting personal impacts. It certainly ingrains a deep sense of patience and the notion that the &lsquo;journey really is the reward&rsquo;. I am still a keen slow, overland traveller, travelling to Ljublijana, Slovenia by train just last week for example to run some sustainability communications masterclasses. I find it a superior more satisfying way to travel which for me is very productive &ndash; my 180mph TGV &lsquo;office&rsquo; is a very comfortable space to work in and lacks the multiple distractions of my normal desk!</p><p>It also changes the way you frame the world and the context of time. Most people say they would like to travel overland but it&rsquo;s too expensive and takes too long. I think in many ways this is a misperception and time is all we really have, so why not lever a few more hours out of your life to enjoy the considered transition of landscape, people, culture and language that travelling in a more grounded fashion entails? It&rsquo;s a richer, more rewarding experience and ultimately delivers you to your destination in a far more relaxed and &lsquo;ready&rsquo; state than a twang on a budget airline!</p><p><strong>Paul: One of the underlying thoughts behind Pimp My Cause is the belief that as mainstream marketers become increasingly required to respond to the needs of sustainable business and good corporate citizenship, one of the best ways for them to learn about creating social and environmental benefits can be by contributing their talent pro bono to a cause that serves a social or environmental mission they can feel inspired by &ndash; what advice would you give a marketer looking to develop their eco-credentials as they develop their career?</strong></p><p>Ed: Well in essence for me it&rsquo;s about &lsquo;purpose&rsquo;. What are you trying to, or hoping to achieve using your creative talents? Do you want to flog catfood or catalytic convertors?! We all seek some form of meaning in our professional and personal lives and I&rsquo;m not sure there should be a divide between the two. Why should you leave your &lsquo;real self&rsquo; at the door when you arrive at work? Surely we should be able to align our personal and professional values to help create a better world for everyone? In our experience as Futerrans it is this passionate belief that everything we do is contributing a positive impact to the world that motivates us. So my advice would be to ask yourself the tough question &ndash; &lsquo;What is your own &lsquo;why&rsquo;?&rsquo;, your purpose? And how best can you live that practically? Because when you do so it will likely make your career much happier and more productive. As our MD Jeff says &lsquo;Work is a 3-letter word spelt J-O-Y!&rsquo;.</p><p><strong>Paul: Which of our member causes have you chosen to advise and why?</strong></p><p>Ed: Well from a personal perspective it had to be <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/389\" target=\"_blank\">Bikes to Rwanda</a> as it combines several of my own passions: international development, coffee and cycling! I&rsquo;m awanna-be-world-changing kind of guy with a caffeine habit and a Dutch bicycle (Futerra also has a pink tandem as our company vehicle!) so it was pretty much a no-brainer.</p><p><strong>Paul: And what ideas or suggestions do you have for them?</strong></p><p>Ed: I think this project has huge potential, especially as the coffee: cycling connection is so contemporary at the moment as demonstrated by the huge success of coffee/bike shops such as &lsquo;Look Mum No Hands&rsquo; (<a href=\"http://www.lookmumnohands.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.lookmumnohands.com</a>)&nbsp; that does a roaring trade (and a great cup of coffee!) down the road from the Futerra office in London. I would look to establish the vital personal connections between coffee-loving cyclists and the Rwandan coffee-growers. For me, as I discuss in this recent talk I gave (virtually!) in Australia (<a href=\"http://www.futerra.co.uk/#go=stories-sizzle-salience-and-social-proof-6005\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.futerra.co.uk/#go=stories-sizzle-salience-and-social-proof-6005</a>) it&rsquo;s all about the &lsquo;Stories, Sizzle, Salience &amp; Social Proof&rsquo;. Bikes for Rwanda should concentrate on telling the compelling, personal stories and narratives of the individual workers they help/supply with bicycles, those who repair the bikes in the field and the crucial role they play in the coffee production process as a whole. Who is bringing that fantastic roasted Rwandan coffee to your grinder and ultimately cup? Why is this exciting or cool, what difference does it make to their lives, life on the coffee farm generally, the coffee steaming in front of you? How can the whole coffee journey be brought to life, visibly in people&rsquo;s minds, using images, films, faces, smiles and families of the beneficiaries of the programme? How can you label coffee drinkers aspublic supporters, endorsers and advocates of the project? There is a wonderful circularity to the both the cycling connections and the coffee cycle itself &ndash; it makes total sense in the context of &lsquo;Bikes to Rwanda&rsquo;s&rsquo; core business and mission to capitalize on this&hellip;and I&rsquo;d love to meet and talk with them further to help explore how we might make this happen.</p>"

We feel incredibly inspired by the quality and ambition of our now 240+ member causes, and greatly impressed by the calibre and commitment of our 400 marketers.<br\/><br\/>25 social ventures have been included in the Nexters programme, and Pimp My Cause is in some great company.<br\/><br\/>One of the other ventures is <a href=\"http://www.ecoinomy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ecoinomy</a>, led by <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/content/information/interviews/a-conversation-with-john-grant-ceo-of-ecoinomy-and-author-of-coopportunity\" target=\"_blank\">John Grant</a>, one of our expert interviewees from earlier in the year and his business partner Robert Colwell. Ecoinomy tracks employees&rsquo; energy/waste saving actions e.g. cutting travel, calculates how much is saved, allocates a share of these savings to community causes chosen by employees clubbing together in Facebook style groups.

They have created a platform to raise funds for good causes through online gaming. They help charities get online by connecting them to existing games (through an in-game object) and get the charity out there to a massive, engaged audience. Their technology includes a real-world achievements and leader board, where in-game actions lead to real world good. Apparently, 3 billion hours per week are spent playing games &ndash; if 1p from every hour was raised to donate to a good cause, the impact would be transformational and the time would be very well spent.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/playmob.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/><br\/><br\/>We look forward to participating in the programme and collaborating with other Nexters.

Richard chose <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/296\" target=\"_blank\">Petit Miracle Interiors</a> a social enterprise offering accredited Interior Design training to increase the employability of people who are economically inactive, specifically vulnerable women, long term unemployed and those who have experienced homelessness.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/pm3.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/pmlogo.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><br\/><br\/>We asked Elisicia Moore, Petit Miracle Interiors founder to share with us how she turned Richard's advice into his ongoing support.<br\/><br\/>\"Firstly, I want to say that we were overjoyed that someone chose to help us with our marketing request, never mind the likes of Richard Hall, very lucky indeed!<br\/><br\/>The feedback from Richard, particularly his three top tips for marketing development were most helpful. When someone who has a proven track record gives you advice, it&rsquo;s a good idea to stand up and pay attention, as well, to follow up with them to say thank you. And that is exactly what we did. But, we got far more than we were expecting.<br\/><br\/>Richard said he could do better than that and suggested meeting up to talk about our dreams, goals and our fears.<br\/><br\/>We have met a few times now and keep in regular contact on email and phone. Richard is incredibly clever and super approachable which makes for good conversation, not to mention, easily enabling me to pick his brain on issues or problems we are facing.<br\/><br\/>Richard shares our passion that we all deserve to enjoy beauty, regardless of our socio-economic background. In addition to Richard&rsquo;s advice he has worked hard to tap into his professional network and is aligning meetings with people we would otherwise never have had the chance to meet.<br\/><br\/>I think that Pimp My Cause is doing far more than perhaps they are aware. The platform to engage charities with professionals has obvious benefits however, the implications these connections can create are innumerable.<br\/><br\/>We, at Petit Miracle&rsquo;s, have aspirations to televise our work in a documentary and/or short TV series. Exploring and bringing awareness to people who have experienced homelessness and the effect of good design has on ones well-being.<br\/><br\/>Richard is helping us to make that dream happen whilst bestowing us with his wisdom. So who knows where this little partnership will take us, but watch this space, because just maybe, we might get this little dream of ours on the telly!&rdquo;</p>"

He went on to spend over a decade at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, and Ogilvy as a Creative Director up to board level on global advertising campaigns and innovative communications for some of the world&rsquo;s best-known companies, including BP, P&amp;G, Cisco, IBM, Castrol, Avis, Toyota, and Visa. He&rsquo;s won over thirty of the world&rsquo;s top global advertising awards, including Grand Prix and DMA, Cannes, D&amp;AD, and sat on global judging panels for digital and integrated advertising.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He set up <a href=\"http://www.thehuntingdynasty.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Hunting Dynasty agency</a> to mix his advertising experience with cognitive-behavioural theories&ndash;such as behavioural economics, behavioural decision theory, and environmental psychology &ndash; to create communications that really work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He is the author of &lsquo;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Inspiring-Sustainable-Behaviour-Ways-Change/dp/1849714002/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1330538266&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\">Inspiring Sustainable Behaviour: 19 Ways To Ask For Change</a>&rsquo; &raquo; available 17th April 2012 (in the UK, later in N. America and other territories) through Routledge/Earthscan which wrangles environmental psychology, behavioural economics, decision theory, and a good old dose of common sense together in a potent handbook for marketers and legislators to ask for and sell persistent, pervasive, and near-costless sustainable behaviour using our hidden quirks, judgmental biases, and apparent irrationalities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Paul Skinner: Beginning with your extensive background in advertising, what would you say were the key insights that have most shaped your work, and how might they translate into tactics that our members could use?</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oliver Payne: Firstly I&rsquo;d say that if other people are contributing to or buying your &lsquo;thing&rsquo;, then say so. We behave similarly to other people and are most influenced by what other &ldquo;people like us&rdquo; do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, compare your &lsquo;thing&rsquo; to a competitor (in your favour). For example by saying &lsquo;100% of our donations go to the cause, unlike Y&rsquo;, or comparing your &lsquo;thing&rsquo; to something crazy (also in your favour), such as &lsquo;You could donate to X or buy eight frappuccinos&rsquo;. Here it is the context in which the choice is made that&rsquo;s important. The alternatives don&rsquo;t have to be similar things, they need to be other choices someone could make.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thirdly, I&rsquo;d say don&rsquo;t be afraid to write CLEAR instructions about WHAT TO DO, RIGHT NOW, ON THIS SITE/PAGE/AD/etc. (For those interested in the psychology of this it is called &ldquo;making the construal level proximal&rdquo;.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Paul: Some very valuable insights there into how people&rsquo;s minds work and therefore how best to communicate to them. On that subject, you&rsquo;ve recently set up an agency, The Hunting Dynasty focusing on behavioural economics. One of the exciting opportunities for our causes to come from the field of behavioural economics is the chance to make their communications much more effective without adding any extra cost &ndash; could you give some further practical examples of how this can be achieved? (oh and for anyone new to behavioural economics &ndash; do read OIiver&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.thehuntingdynasty.com/2010/03/the-dinner-party-kit-a-bluffers-guide-to-behavioural-economics/\" target=\"_blank\">bluffer&rsquo;s guide</a>&rdquo;)</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oliver: The important thing to grasp is simple but fundamental: there&rsquo;s no way to present information (or choice, or options, or communication &ndash; however you want to describe it) without the presentation affecting the outcome. In many cases the presentation is the outcome.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The second most important thing to recognise is that while Behavioural Economics is interesting, and helpful up to a point for the marketer, one should look to the broader cognitive-behaviour theories to affect change (behavioural decision theory, psychology in general &ndash; and in the case of my book, environmental psychology).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, temporal discounting (or hyperbolic discounting) is an important part of the behavioural economics canon that tells us how we vary our perception of the value of money over time relative to ourselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, being offered &pound;10 now or &pound;11 tomorrow usually results in people taking &pound;10 now, whereas being offered &pound;10 in a year or &pound;11 in a year and one day, usually results in taking the &pound;11 option. We only change our answer relative to where we are in time compared to the cash. However, this does not give full dimension to construal, where the &lsquo;level&rsquo; at which we construe something affects behaviour greatly. It happens in these dimensions: here/not here; me/not me; now/not now; clear/unclear.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Construal gives us interesting insight into decision-making: Trope, Liberman, and Wakslak examined how our opinions of main and peripheral aspects of a product change depending on when we think about the product more than what the aspects are: &lsquo;participants thinking about the purchase [of a clock-radio] in the distant future expressed more satisfaction when the central feature was good and the peripheral one was poor (i.e., the sound quality was good and the clock poor)&rsquo;. In the same experiment, participants thinking about the clock in the moment expressed satisfaction when either the central feature or the peripheral one was poor. They are both our decisions, but they beg the question; who are we? Which is our true decision?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, it is clear how you present choice (your product, charity, desired action) will affect assessment of it. Knowing this, we can present choice in a way favourable to the seller. Or to the buyer. Or to some other third party.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Paul: So the way you express the choices you offer people greatly affects the options they are likely to choose. A lot of organizations are starting to take this kind of research far more into account when developing their communications and even their fundamental innovation. But as the concepts of behavioural economics become better known to the public, is there any evidence that people &ldquo;see through it&rdquo; or are less likely to be influenced by its practice?</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oliver: I get this question &ndash; or variations of it &ndash; quite a lot. More from government than business, and I get it in the form of &lsquo;isn&rsquo;t this just spin?&rsquo; To ask such a question is to fundamentally misunderstand the cognitive-behavioural approach. There is no such thing as an odourless, colourless, neutral presentation. There is no &lsquo;see through&rsquo; it. It just is. Whether you know it or not, whether you believe in it or not, whether you recognise it or not, you twist peoples&rsquo; answers by the way you ask questions, and they twist yours. The world is a tangled spaghetti of quirks and biases unknown, unrecognised, and unavoidable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, Strack, Martin, and Schwartz conducted an experiment in 1988 where they asked only two questions. These were unrelated, and asked in the only two possible sequences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If asked to rate &lsquo;happiness with life-as-a-whole&rsquo; before &lsquo;happiness with dating&rsquo;, there was no real link. You could be happy or sad, dating or not, and it wouldn&rsquo;t relate in any meaningful way &ndash; is the conclusion you&rsquo;d draw.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But if the order was flipped and respondents were asked to rate &lsquo;happiness with dating&rsquo; before &lsquo;happiness with life-as-a-whole&rsquo; the link between dating and happiness was almost 3.5 times greater. Therefore, being in a relationship made you more likely to be happy &ndash; is the conclusion you&rsquo;d draw.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The only truth is, that in cases such as this, the order is the outcome.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You ask if there is a reduction in influence over time, when if fact there&rsquo;s never been an absence of influence for thousands of years. The really interesting question is why do we fall prey to cognitive-behavioural quirks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An anthropological answer is needed &ndash; simply put we&rsquo;re really good at living the short and brutal lives we&rsquo;ve been living for the last 195,000 years, and we&rsquo;re really poor at living the long and comfortable lives we&rsquo;ve had for the last 160-or-so years. Since 1850 life expectancy has increased by &ndash; on average &ndash; six hours per day. Six hours per day! It&rsquo;s no wonder that we&rsquo;re poor at making decisions about pensions (or, even, making the decision to have one). The gap between our ancient selves and the modern world is where our behaviour becomes a &lsquo;quirk&rsquo;, where our behaviour becomes an &lsquo;apparent irrationality&rsquo;, where we become unfit for navigating the world around us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That is the gap I work in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Paul: Here at Pimp My Cause we love nothing more than a great sneak preview &ndash; what can you tell us about your</strong><br\/><strong>upcoming book, Inspiring Sustainable Behaviour: 19 Ways to Ask for Change?</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oliver: I wrangle together insights from a wide range of psychological research to create a coherent guide to creating communications that create painless and permanent change. I think it&rsquo;s both pragmatic and inspirational, and works well as a handbook for marketers and legislators to create sustainable behaviour.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I wrote it around a &lsquo;how to ask&rsquo; structure that I had a lot of success with in presentations; &lsquo;Just ask&rsquo;, &lsquo;Ask with the right words&rsquo;, &lsquo;Ask with the right images&rsquo;, etc. is all pretty much business as usual &ndash; or so it seems, although simply asking a question can kill people (the mere measurement effect is at work here).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then we go a little off-piste with sections about adding options and taking them away, about telling rather than asking, about asking for a commitment (but not now), and it&rsquo;s all held together with stories about Popeye&rsquo;s Chicken and Biscuits on the West Cermak Road in Chicago, the Warring States period in China around 221 BC, a set of stairs in Lisbon, and Ignaz Semmelweis and his &lsquo;cadaverous particles&rsquo;.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It starts with Schrodinger&rsquo;s cat, ends with Kaiser Wilhelm II, and never fails to tell you how to create sustainable behaviour.</p><p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Paul: Wow! It sounds like an encyclopedia of psychological insight for anyone wanting to create positive change in</strong><br\/><strong>the world!</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oilver, as you know at this point in our interviews we ask our guests to choose one or two of our member causes and develop some ideas for them. Which of our causes have you chosen and why?</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oliver: There&rsquo;s two that stood out: <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/896\" target=\"_blank\">Cancer Research UK</a>; <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/1060\" target=\"_blank\">Out Of The Dark</a>.</p><p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Paul: And what is your advice for them?</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oliver: Cancer Research is looking for volunteers to help raise money. I guess it&rsquo;s a perennial challenge. They want digital banner ads, in paid-for media spaces.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Non-marketeers would probably try to find the solution in the facts: how much you could raise, where it goes, why it&rsquo;s needed, why it&rsquo;s vital. Always appealing to the rational with the truth. It doesn&rsquo;t drive behaviour, however.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Marketeers generally will propose raising awareness (which will lead to interest, desire, and action, of course) by creating some emotional connection; perhaps dramatizing the plight of those who&rsquo;re suffering, the lives made whole by those who survived, or how every penny raised makes a difference, in order to appeal to feelings with storytelling. It doesn&rsquo;t drive behaviour, however.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A cognitive-behavioural communicator will tell you that we tend to behave similarly &lsquo;to people like us&rsquo;, and would go on to cite Cialdini et al.&rsquo;s towel reuse experiment in Arizona where messages about saving the environment (although true) had no effect on behaviour, but messages that said &lsquo;X% of people who stayed in this room recycled their towel&rsquo; saw recycling rates shoot up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This &lsquo;provincial norm&rsquo; is powerful, and cuts across age, sex, postcode, and politics. The cog-behavioural communicator will tell you to write the digital banner ads that they ask for saying &lsquo;people who visited this page signed up to volunteer for Cancer Research&rsquo;, and other hyper-local messages to evoke the provincial norm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A cognitive-behavioural communicator will also tell you that incremental requests lead to much larger requests that would be denied if asked from a standing start. They could cite the election candidate window poster/all-weather lawn sign request experiments where respondents ended up with fixed hammered-in &lsquo;keep off the grass&rsquo; type signs on their front lawn &ndash; or not &ndash;- depending on whether they were asked a smaller favour first. And they would suggest sequential ads that ask hypothetical incremental requests: &lsquo;If someone had a spare 5mins should they volunteer to. . .&rsquo;, &lsquo;If you had a spare 5mins would you volunteer . . .&rsquo;, &lsquo;if I asked you to canvas for donations to Cancer Research, would you? . . and so on. They need work, but the principles are there. And there are more approaches.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I recommend they follow the advice described by the cognitive-behavioural communicator. (With recognition that it will need finessing over time, because these things are harder to get working than they look &ndash; a bit of honesty never hurt.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, Out Of The Dark renovates old furniture to sell. At least, that&rsquo;s one strand of their work: the renovators are drawn from backgrounds that don&rsquo;t normally have access to this type of vocational training, or experience. Out Of The Dark wants to be financially self-sufficient.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are many strands to the work they do, but the only real way to drive self-sufficiency is to sell, sell, sell, every table, chair, chest of draws and display cabinet they&rsquo;ve got. Over, and over, again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The first place many marketers will go is to draw people to the proposition, to define the Unique Selling Point, and leverage it &ndash; uniqueness is priceless, for instance &ndash; to create desire to own and to be seen to own these amazing objects from a kind-of &lsquo;Jamie Oliver&rsquo;s Fifteen&rsquo; of furniture. This will work, to some degree. As will smoothing out the e-commerce option, and a little bit of PR. All of these approaches can be refined by psychology.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But some of the most successful cognitive-behavioural solutions to retail problems have been decidedly left-field &ndash; none more so that the US company 1-800-Mattress who secured 80% of the New York mattress market by offering to take customers' old bedding away. The real barrier to purchasing a new mattress wasn&rsquo;t the price, or the provenance, the technology, the finance plan, or its lifespan &ndash; it was the problem of what to do with the old one. This solution took into account that, despite the success or otherwise in getting people interested, when the moment comes to actually committing to buy, the problem of getting rid of the old furniture looms large enough to stop the sale. Understanding mindsets at key decision-points and removing the physical and psychological barriers to purchase is the central game of cognitive-behavioural drafted in service of consumer problems.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I recommend Out Of The dark offer to take the old sideboard away for free (which is a great new donation, too), or heavily promote it if they already offer that. Or indeed, to become that service. All the other marketing stuff will help too, but nothing will fire-up turnover like this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Paul: Many thanks Oliver for all your insights and we wish you all the best for the launch of your book!</strong></p>"

  "content": "<h2>Press Coverage for Oscar Winning Documentary Highlighting Acid Attacks</h2><p><br\/><br\/>A couple of days before the Academy Awards the founder of <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/400\" target=\"_blank\">Acid Survivors Trust International (ASTI)</a>, Dr John Morrison OBE, got in touch with Pimp My Cause and asked for our help in getting publicity. They knew that they had a great opportunity, but didn't know how to take advantage of the fact that a the short documentary film <em>Saving Face</em>, about the plight of two young women in Pakistan who have been attacked with acid, was up for Best Short Documentary Film. <br\/><br\/><em><a href=\"http://oscar.go.com/nominees/documentary-short-subject/saving-face\" target=\"_blank\">Saving Face</a></em> follows the plight of two young women in Pakistan who have had their faces and lives destroyed &ndash; they had acid thrown at them with the deliberate intention to wound and stigmatise. <span>ASTI</span> supports a network of partners who provide surgical treatment and rehabilitation to around 1000 survivors every year and they supported co-directors Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy and Daniel Junge in their quest to tell the story of acid attack survivors, Zakia and Rukhsan.<br\/><br\/>ASTI has been working for over a decade to help survivors of acid attacks. It established the organisation featured in the film &ndash; the <a href=\"http://acidsurvivorspakistan.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Acid Survivors Foundation</a> in Pakistan and supports four other similar organisations in Bangladesh, Nepal, Uganda and Cambodia. It is the only organisation anywhere in the world whose sole mission is to eliminate acid attacks.<br\/><br\/>After John updated us on their activities we were very motivated to help, but it was difficult to find PR experts who could step in and help with such a short time frame. On the Monday morning after the Oscars we woke up to hear the news that <em>Saving Face</em> had won Best Short Documentary. And although we are not PR experts ourselves we helped John create a press release and quickly sent it out to all of the journalists we thought might be interested.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/sv2.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/></p><p><br\/> Within a few days of sending out the press release there was interest from Grazia magazine and a powerful two page spread was published in last week's Grazia (April 2, 2012 issue) on page 48.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Acid violence is a largely unreported crime that happens all over the world, is not characterised by creed, continent or culture but is mainly perpetrated against young women and girls. <span>ASTI</span> calculates that there are at least 1,500 reported attacks on innocent victims every year &ndash; but many more go unreported.<br\/> <br\/>&ldquo;The women who decided to be a part of the documentary did so because they wanted to make their voices heard and wanted to bring attention to this form of assault,&rdquo; Chinoy said in an interview conducted before she won the Oscar. &ldquo;The main reason that they are in <em>Saving Face</em> is to make their stories heard and have an impact.&rdquo; Many victims are women attacked by their husbands, and others assaulted for turning down a proposal of marriage. One girl in the documentary describes how she was burned after rejecting the advances of her teacher. She was 13 at the time.<br\/> <br\/>\"We have commissioned research into this crime, sent teams of volunteers to help survivors, and brought this crime to the attention of the UN and other international human rights agencies,\" explains John Morrison, founder of <span>ASTI</span>, \"and for those inspired by Saving Face, <span>ASTI</span> has designed a programme with the film makers to raise awareness following the film&rsquo;s release.\"<br\/> <br\/><em>Saving Face</em> premiered in the UK at the Human Rights Film Festival on 28th and 29th March 2012 and will be showing on channel 4 in early April (we will update this when we know the date and time).</p>"

In 2006 Doug received an honorary Queen&rsquo;s Award for Enterprise Promotion for his work promoting, developing and helping entrepreneurs. Through his latest venture, <a href=\"http://www.schoolforstartups.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">School for Startups</a>, he has delivered instruction to more than 10,000 business owners with help from universities, public institutions like the British Library and philanthropic organizations like the Royal Institute of Great Britain. In 2010 Richard received the Enterprise Educator of the year award from the National Council on Graduate Employment for his work through School for Startups with UK Universities. We thought to ask him to do an expert interview for Pimp My Cause when one of our volunteers attended School for Startup&rsquo;s free Web Fueled Business event in Liverpool and was inspired by Doug&rsquo;s vision of entrepreneurship as a force for good. <br\/></span></span></strong></span></div><div style=\"margin: 0px; font: 12px 'Lucida Grande';\"><span style=\"letter-spacing: 0px;\"><strong><br\/></strong></span></div><div style=\"margin: 0px; font: 12px 'Lucida Grande';\"><span style=\"letter-spacing: 0px;\"><strong>Paul Skinner: Many people know you through your participation in the Dragons&rsquo; Den - how did your participation in the show affect your thinking about entrepreneurship?</strong></span></div><div style=\"margin: 0px; font: 12px 'Lucida Grande'; min-height: 15px;\">&nbsp;</div><div style=\"margin: 0px; font: 12px 'Lucida Grande';\"><span style=\"letter-spacing: 0px;\">Doug Richard: For the two years that I was on Dragons&rsquo; Den I learnt to make the distinction between product and pitch. Whilst you can&rsquo;t make a bad product good, it is possible to coach entrepreneurs lacking in skills to become better at running a business.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=\"margin: 0px; font: 12px 'Lucida Grande'; min-height: 15px;\">&nbsp;</div><div style=\"margin: 0px; font: 12px 'Lucida Grande';\"><span style=\"letter-spacing: 0px;\">However, there is very little training out there for those who want to learn how to start up - so I started School for Startups to fill this gap.</span></div><div style=\"margin: 0px; font: 12px 'Lucida Grande'; min-height: 15px;\">&nbsp;</div><div style=\"margin: 0px; font: 12px 'Lucida Grande';\"><span style=\"letter-spacing: 0px;\"><strong>Paul: You have mentored more than 10,000 businesses, most recently through the School for Startups.

With increased competition for grants and donations, many organisations are having to rethink their financial model and explore more sustainable options, such as earned income or loans. But what does this mean in practice for the finance team?</p><p><a title=\" href=\"http://www.epilepsyscotland.org.uk/\">Epilepsy Scotland</a> decided to take the leap into social enterprise. The charity was looking for an innovative initiative that could deliver a long-term, sustainable funding stream based on future trends that could exist alongside traditional funding opportunities. Online shopping was identified as a growth market, and payment systems were recognised as an element of that sector which could deliver ongoing income from one-off sales.</p><p>Launched last year, <a title=\" href=\"http://www.charityclear.com/\">CharityClear</a> is a payment service provider that delivers payment authorisation to online merchants with 100% of the profits going to Epilepsy Scotland (CharityClear was set up as a community interest company). It is the first such payment provider in the UK.</p><p>Gordon Quinn, sales and marketing director at CharityClear, was a trustee of Epilepsy Scotland when the idea began to get off the ground three years ago. For him, the greatest challenge was to win over his fellow trustees who had to sign off on a &pound;150,000 investment with little or no previous knowledge of the online payments market. \"The main challenge to overcome was the fact that CharityClear was a bold idea whose operations were nothing to do with epilepsy,\" he explains. \"The returns, however, would be directed to services and activities to benefit the 54,000 people living with epilepsy in Scotland.\"</p><p>In addition to the initial investment, the finance team also had to work into its planning an ongoing financial commitment to CharityClear through the period before achieving a profit. The charity's finance and fundraising teams work closely with CharityClear to track income.</p><p>Jane Arnott, acting head of advice and consultancy at the Charities Aid Foundation, agrees that trustees' attitude to risk is vitally important and says the finance team should work closely with the board to communicate ideas for new income streams. \"We advise charities to think about corporate engagement as a partnership and what the benefits of that partnership are,\" she says. \"It's an opportunity to develop the skills of their staff &ndash; particularly if you come from a background of writing applications for grants, which can be quite transactional.\"</p><p>Arnott says the shift away from unpredictable income streams is becoming more widespread. \"Organisations are looking to diversify their funding portfolio and looking at more innovative ways of income generation,\" she says. \"They are also looking at how to maximise existing funding opportunities such as payroll or corporate giving.\"</p><p>According to a salary survey conducted by Charity Finance Group last year, finance teams have not experienced the same levels of staff cuts as other areas. However, they appeared to be working longer hours, a possible indicator that they are taking on other responsibilities such as IT and HR as other teams are squeezed. The challenge for many finance teams is how best to \"skill up\" with limited resources.</p><p><a title=\" href=\"http://www.partnersofprisoners.co.uk/\">Partners of Prisoners and Family Support Group</a> is a medium-sized charity set up in 1988 to provide advice and help to offenders and their families across the UK. It has recently set up a trading arm to provide refreshments for offenders' families in visitor centre tea bars. Its social enterprise &ndash; 2nd Chance &ndash; provides sandwiches made by offenders and ex-offenders and sold in the tea bars.</p><p>\"We needed to invest in upskilling staff with the ability to write and manage tender opportunities,\" says Zoe Gan-Rankin, the business development manager. \"We also had to develop an understanding of trading and tax law to legally and efficiently manage our income generating activities.\" To embed the concept across the organisations, key staff were also given training, such as Acevo's\"financial management for non-accountants\" course. The charity also expanded membership of the board, recruiting trustees with legal or corporate finance experience.</p><p>When youth engagement charity <a title=\" href=\"http://www.otesha.org.uk/\">The Otesha Project UK</a> was launched in May 2007, the organisation was entirely funded by grants. By the second year, earned income accounted for one-third of its income, generated through running school workshops and educational cycle tours. More recently, it has added greener workplaces training to its services and is currently looking at setting up a community interest company for such activities.</p><p>Founder and project director Liz McDowell explains that, unlike a grant where you receive the money up front or in instalments, earned income means issuing invoices and being paid afterwards &ndash; and after paying for much of the related outgoings, just as a business does. \"Without grant funding, we wouldn't have the cushion to achieve this unless we resorted to taking out a loan,\" she says. \"In terms of financial planning, this change has made our cashflows a much more important part of the planning, monitoring and bookkeeping tasks.\"</p><p>NCVO recently surveyed subscribers to its funding and finance e-newsletter to find out where organisations thought income opportunities for them were over the next five years. Of the respondents, 60% said donations or grants offered medium-sized opportunities, 50% said contracts and 44% opted for trading. Asked about high opportunities for income, respondents were divided equally between the three areas.</p><p>NCVO's sustainable funding project offers a mix of online and face-to-face resources including books, blogs, guides, consultancy and training (such as the forthcoming grow your own income course). Jess Farr, sustainable funding officer, says new skills will depend on the funding route they take. For example, trading requires the team to forecast and monitor profit margins, turnover, costs and capital investment. And an understanding of the difference between different types of trading will also be extremely important for tax purposes.</p><p>Finance professionals can also seek informal support via specialist forums, such as the KnowHow NonProfit funding forum.</p><p>Quinn at Epilepsy Scotland says changing mindsets is half the battle: \"The charity is taking a long-term view in establishing this enterprise, to develop a consistent income stream to lessen reliance on extremely valuable but unpredictable sources of income.\"</p></div></div>"

And this session was dedicated to building strategic collaborative advantage.<br\/><br\/>During the workshop 20 or 30 development NGO&rsquo;s worked interactively to apply a five part creative framework to enable them to re-imagine any aspect of their organisation, new initiative they might be thinking of undertaking, or campaign they would like to develop, as a &ldquo;platform for participation&rdquo;, harnessing external talent to spread their message and deliver their results.<br\/><br\/>Pimp My Cause has increased its connection to international development in 2012 with assignments in humanitarian response and post-crisis re-development and has seen parallels between participatory approaches to marketing and engagement-oriented approaches to development. The workshop was an opportunity to explore some of the themes of the Big Society agenda and to reflect on how these themes can be harnessed to increase the profile of international development organisations.</span></p><p><span style=\"letter-spacing: 0px;\"><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/bond2cropped.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/><br\/><br\/>As Boris Wolf at Bond commented after the event, &ldquo;The workshop enabled the participants to think creatively about the wider context in which NGOs operate, the wider constituencies that could support their work and how a clear vision of this context and these constituencies could result in improved marketing and impact. Thanks to Paul and other Pimp My Cause staff's skillful facilitation, organisations who struggle to realise the wider opportunities offered by new technologies and social media were supported in developing breakthrough participatory innovation.\"</span></p>"

Could you give us some examples of what you mean by that?</strong></p><p><br\/>Ken Banks: Since developing a solution to a problem I didn't originally set out to solve, I've become increasingly interested in reluctant, accidental and serendipitous innovation. There's an ongoing debate in the social innovation and social entrepreneurship worlds around whether you can teach innovation, and with an increasing focus on it at university and in academia many people clearly believe you can.</p><p>What really interests and excites me, though, are innovators who didn't have that kind of training or background who come up with high impact solutions to problems they may not have originally been aware of, let alone had any interest in solving. The fact they did is, in my view, what makes them \"reluctant\". Believing in this form of innovation democratises the opportunity, I believe, and sends out the message that you don't need qualifications or an MBA to develop a world beating social solution. This is powerful, and empowering, and a message we need to share more.<br\/><br\/>As part of my drive to do just that I'm in the process of pulling together a book on the phenomenon - which should be out by the end of the year - which features the stories and work of about a dozen reluctant innovators. In my recent Wired Magazine article - which built on an <a href=\"http://www.kiwanja.net/blog/2011/02/the-rise-of-the-reluctant-innovator/\" target=\"_blank\">earlier post</a> I'd written on the subject - I provided two examples of people I considered typical reluctant innovators. Here are two short summaries of their stories:<br\/><br\/><em>One evening in 1996, Brij Kothari was watching a DVD of Pedro Almod&oacute;var&rsquo;s &ldquo;Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown&rdquo; with friends in Ithaca, New York. The dialogue was in Spanish and the subtitles in English. Out of nowhere an idea popped into his head. As a Spanish language learner, he wished the subtitles were also in Spanish. Turning his attention home, he wondered whether India could become literate if Bollywood-made Hindi films and songs were shown with the lyrics subtitled in Hindi. The idea behind same language subtitling &ndash; or SLS &ndash; was born. Today, thanks to Brij&rsquo;s organisation Planet Read, Indian primary school children numbering in the hundreds of millions are learning basic literacy by simply watching their favourite television programmes. Not bad for something conjured up in front of a Saturday night movie.</em><br\/><br\/><em>Then there&rsquo;s Laura Stachel, whose organisation &ndash; WE CARE Solar &ndash; designs portable solar lighting kits for maternity wards in developing countries. When she first headed out to Nigeria she planned to work on a different problem altogether, but quickly realised that a simple lack of lighting was responsible for an unacceptable number of mother and child deaths. Maternal mortality rates in Nigeria are among the highest in the world, with a ratio of 1,100 maternal deaths occurring for every 100,000 live births, so she turned her attention to helping design, build and distribute solar kits to solve it. &ldquo;As an American doctor, it was inconceivable that a hospital could function without reliable electricity. The lack of lighting for a cesarean section was a problem I had never imagined&rdquo;. Laura never intended to build and run an organisation, and never chose to become a solar innovator, but seeing a problem she felt compelled to fix, she reluctantly became one. Solar Suitcases are now saving the lives of mothers and babies in hundreds of delivery rooms throughout the developing world.</em><br\/><br\/>(&ldquo;Genius happens when you plan something else&rdquo;, Wired UK, June 2012).</p><p><br\/>As I thought more and more about this type of innovation, and began to see it in more and more places, I started to wonder what percentage of innovation was planned and studied as opposed to unplanned and accidental. For me there's a certain romance in the latter, and that's something I hope to tease out a little more in the forthcoming book.<br\/><br\/><strong>Paul: Are there any ways to increase the chances of this kind of &ldquo;happy accident&rdquo; occurring?</strong></p><p><br\/>Ken: I talked a little about this during a recent interview with a US radio show. There's no particular secret, but narrowing it down I'd say there are a five things someone could do that might help.</p><p>First, in the words of National Geographic you should \"live curious\". As children we're always asking questions, wondering why things are a certain way, wondering how they work and so on. As we get older that curiosity tends to get knocked out of us, and keeping hold of it can be a great asset. If anything, there's more to be curious about today than there ever was. So question everything, seek answers, and don't stop there if you're not happy with them.</p><p>Second, read widely. I became interested in international development in 1993 after a trip to Zambia, and following that trip immersed myself in dozens of books on the subject. I became so curious I ended up studying the subject at university three years later.</p><p>Three, put yourself in the kinds of environments where you're more likely to see and experience things. A few years back I was becoming increasingly interested in primate conservation, bush meat hunting and deforestation, so I headed off to Nigeria for a year to work at a sanctuary. I learnt more about the workings of conservation and grassroots NGOs in that time than I ever could have by reading books. Sometimes you have to almost smell and taste the problem to get a sense of its scale.</p><p>Four, don't over-plan. I left settling down very late in the grand scheme of things (getting married in my late 30's, buying my first home around the same time) but that did mean I was largely debt free and able to move around freely as random opportunities arose. Since 1993 I've lived and worked in several African countries and helped with everything from school and hospital building through to primate rehabilitation, biodiversity surveying and IT research. Without a doubt it's that breadth of knowledge and experience which allows me to do what I do today. At the time many of the things I did didn't appear to really tie together but today they're all equally as important in my work. \"Where technology meets anthropology, conservation and development\" is kiwanja's strap line, and it captures the four things I'm most passionate about.</p><p>And that leads me to my fifth and final bit of advice. If your ideal job doesn't exist, create it. <br\/><br\/><strong>Paul: People who know you now might assume you have always been a leading figure in ICT for development. But from hearing you speak it turns out that you created FrontlineSMS, the platform that empowers development through open source communications software, with very little support and even spent a year living in a camper van to get it off the ground. Many of&nbsp; our causes also have to make a great deal out of very little on a daily basis to achieve their goals. Do you feel there are ways to turn scarce resources into a positive?</strong></p><p><br\/>Ken: One of my favourite quotes goes along the lines of \"some of the best innovation comes about out of scarcity\". When I think about what I've seen over the past 20 years across Africa, I'd have to agree. If you have few resources - and that can be anything from skills to networks to funding - you do tend to do things differently. Because of my belief in bottom-up development, FrontlineSMS was always going to be a tool that end-users in the developing world could simply take and deploy on their own. That was how I wanted it. But the fact that it was only me in the beginning - it stayed that way for about four years - and that I had a day job paying the bills, meant that I knew I wouldn't have the time or resources to provide full support. So it was designed in a way that meant users were least likely to need any - it was simple to install and use, didn't need a manual, could be easily copied and replicated, and was free.</p><p>After developing the software over five weeks while on holiday in Finland in the summer of 2005, it was released to the world a few months later in October. At that stage I just let it go, and carried on with my consultancy work. It only received a very small amount of funding (which I used to buy my first laptop, and some phones and cables), so there was no real pressure or expectation for it to make a huge impact. And since it wasn't funded by a major donor there wasn't an end-point where funding would run out and the project would potentially close down. One main advantage looking back was that I could keep it going at minimal cost simply by dedicating a few hours a week to it (mostly answering questions from users, prospective users, and the media).</p><p>That was key because it wasn't until April 2007 - 18 months later - that it got it's first big break when it was used to monitor the Nigerian Presidential elections. At that time I was at Stanford University on a Fellowship, helping about a dozen social innovators develop their own ideas. After the Nigerian elections it became clear that my own project had potential, so I turned my attention back to it. Amazingly, I had almost shut FrontlineSMS down a few months earlier. And, yes, during my time at Stanford personal funds were incredibly tight so I lived in a VW camper for two years. I continued to live in it after I was funded by the MacArthur Foundation (who introduced me in emails as \"the man in the van\"). It kept life simple, and kept me focused. Silicon Valley is the kind of place you can get lost in, and I wanted to make sure I didn't sell myself short by not pursuing the non-profit ideas that really switched me on.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/vw-camper-kiwanja-full.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/><br\/><br\/><strong>Paul: We understand that FrontlineSMS is now at a point in its development where you have been able to appoint a new executive team and free up some of your own time to work on new projects. What can you tell us about your plans for your new Means of Exchange programme?</strong></p><p><br\/>Ken: If I think about my work with FrontlineSMS, and the broader topics that interest me, one theme emerges - how we might use modern communications technology to empower people to connect with their communities for meaningful, social benefit. FrontlineSMS, of course, always had a developing country focus and it's now in use in approaching one hundred countries around the world. What I wanted to do next was focus on a problem closer to home, and this is something I'm now able to do following our announcement in May that I'll be stepping back operationally from FrontlineSMS (read announcement <a href=\"http://www.frontlinesms.com/2012/05/29/a-transition-announcement-from-our-founder-ken-banks/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>).</p><p><a href=\"http://www.meansofexchange.com\" target=\"_blank\">Means of Exchange</a> is part of my new focus, and the site is something I hope will become something of a hub for people interested in how we promote economic self-sufficiency. In short, Means of Exchange focuses on methods of economic self‐sufficiency, community building and local empowerment. At its core it will focus on how emerging, everyday technologies - primarily mobile phones and social media - can be used to democratise economic empowerment, rebuild local communities and promote a return to local resource use. Over the course of the year I'm planning to develop and distribute a suite of apps giving citizens the tools they need to take better control, and better exploit, their own economic opportunities. Although this project has been in the planning for around 18 months, recent events mean the timing is now perfect. I'll be writing more, and announcing details of the first app, on my blog in the next month or so.<br\/><br\/><strong>Paul: You also have an interest in games as a platform for achieving positive social and environmental impact - what can you tell us about the Silverback conservation game you developed?</strong></p><p><br\/>Ken: Silverback was mobile conservation game developed in 2003 during my time at Fauna &amp; Flora International. It was re-released following the high-profile killing of a number of gorillas in national parks by rebels in 2008. The original idea was to teach people about gorilla conservation while they played a fun game, and to that end it succeeded (scoring highly in the commercial mobile gaming press). Although a game, strong educational elements were included as the player worked through eight levels, facing a range of threats and challenges a gorilla would expect in the wild. \"Face the challenges of life in the forest as you grow from a juvenile gorilla into a fully-grown silverback. Across eight challenging levels try to guide yourself and your new family to the safety of the reserve, but watch out for fires, traps, poachers and rival silverbacks\".</p><p>Although a flagship project, Silverback was part of a wider initiative funded by the Vodafone Group Foundation which sought to address two key questions. First was how to make the most of cutting edge technology to bring mobile phone users closer to conservation, and how people could be connected more directly to conservation projects and issues in a way that was enjoyable, novel and created a sense of personal involvement. Secondly was how mobile phone connectivity could work for conservation in the field, in communities where poverty was an overwhelming fact of life and where conservation was seen as a luxury of the wealthy. Silverback was one of a number of games we developed, along with a suite of animal ringtones and wallpapers, and a mobile internet site, all under the banner of <a href=\"http://www.kiwanja.net/wildlive!.htm\" target=\"_blank\">wildlive</a>!</p><p><br\/><strong>Paul: At this point in our interviews we ask our guests to pick out one or two of their favourite causes from Pimp My Cause and to let us know why they have chosen them. Who would you like to choose and why?</strong><br\/><br\/>Ken: There are so many great causes in your community so this is a tough one. But if you were to force my hand I think my choice would have to be <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/1190\" target=\"_blank\">The Hackney Pirates</a>. I'm fully supportive of any organisation that works to educate, empower and inspire young people, and to a degree their work reflects some of the things I try to do, albeit at a different level, through the various mentoring programs I'm involved with. I've seen some of their work at first hand, and met some of the staff and management, and they're an incredibly talented and dedicated bunch.</p><p>Other than the significant impact they're having with the children they support, The Hackney Pirates have also managed to take a concept that some children might resist and made it fun and playful with a brand that is both great and unique both visually and textually (I love their use of pirate terms in their literature). It's the combination of fun, focus, impact and brand that makes them my choice. <br\/><br\/><strong>Paul: At Pimp My Cause we are not so concerned with technology itself as we are with what you can do with technology. And in particular how the democratization of communications technology can help purpose-driven organizations achieve breakthrough results. How would you advise The Hackney Pirates to explore using communications technology to achieve their goals, or what ideas would you suggest for them?</strong><br\/><br\/>Ken: The Hackney Pirates brand has huge potential in today's social media and smart phone-driven world, the very places young people feel naturally \"at home\". They already have a Twitter account, and with around 700 followers there's still plenty of room for growth. I'd ramp up the frequency of tweets a little, most of which focus on news from the organisation, and look to gain a little more social currency by retweeting others working in a related space. Of course, Twitter is a challenge due to its character limit but their Facebook page does a fantastic job of promoting stories of the work they do with children, and in promoting playful events like \"The Young Pirate Apprentice\".</p><p>It's difficult to comment on their strategy - and how they might better use technology - without knowing their wider plans and intentions, but I'd say the one area they've probably got the most (as yet untapped) potential would be on mobile. A pirate social network linking fellow pirates, for example, so children could connect and share stories and experiences. Or pirate-themed educational games, where children gained \"gold coins\" for attaining a certain level. Even fun apps where people could add parrots or pirate hats or claws to photos they've taken of family and friends, which could then be uploaded and shared through an online platform. All of these would raise awareness for them and their work among their target audience, and build on their fun and unique theme.<br\/><br\/></p>"

While it&rsquo;s satisfying to get some of the big name charities on board, many of the most exciting sign-ups are from start-up social ventures with first-in-kind business models or ideas. Like Wheelchair Laser Tag. Marketers find it almost irresistible to want to help our causes get to the next level of development. <br\/><br\/><em>Our Marketers</em><br\/><br\/>Our marketers typically have 10-15 years of professional experience and include many award and multi-award winners. Tapping in to that pool of talent and expertise is proving invaluable to our causes time and time again. Take the case of European Disaster Volunteers who approached one of our marketers for help making a success of a seasonal campaign, and ended up securing her services pro bono for 6 months.<br\/><br\/><em>Team</em><br\/><br\/>We&rsquo;ve steadily added to our core team through the year. This has included substantially adding to our web development capability and taking on a chief-matchmaker to provide facilitated matching to catalyze new connections across the platform. <br\/><br\/><em>Ambassadors</em><br\/><br\/>Our Amabassador network is literally a line-up of some of our personal heroes across the voluntary sector and the marketing profession - and if you are not yet supporting Pimp My Cause one of them WILL find you...<br\/><br\/><em>Partnership with The Triodos Bank</em><br\/><br\/>The Triodos Bank specializes in sustainable finance and moved quickly to support Pimp My Cause while still in its first few weeks of activity. If more banks worked like Triodos, the current economic landscape could look very different. <br\/><br\/><em>Nexters</em><br\/><br\/>Being picked out as one of the most promising social ventures in the UK by the Nexters programme was a great recognition - and opened the doors to support from a new network of people and organisations whose aspirations resonate strongly with our own.<br\/><br\/><em>UnLtd</em><br\/><br\/>UnLtd have provided us with grant-funding, advice and support - and watch this space for further collaboration on its way in year two as we extend our ability to support their own network of social enterprises.<br\/><br\/><em>Bond</em><br\/><br\/>In 2012 we have been ramping up our interest in international development. Once such example has included teaming up with Bond, the membership organisation for development NGOs to deliver training in participatory approaches to marketing for around 30 of their member NGOs.<br\/><br\/><em>Join Our Core</em><br\/><br\/>The last days of year one saw us invited to participate in the semi-finals of the Ben and Jerry&rsquo;s Join Our Core competition to find the top social ventures from across five countries.&nbsp;&nbsp; We pitched in the Dragon&rsquo;s Den, were interviewed by the brilliant Lucy Siegle and saw two of our member causes successfully make it to the final in Uganda.<br\/><br\/><strong>Year Two - Achieving impact at scale and crossing new frontiers for marketing</strong><br\/><br\/>The Pimp My Cause pro bono platform is now fully robust and ready to scale. So our first goal for year two is to empower more marketers to contribute more talent to more causes. Our plans include working with a top agency to raise awareness and support among the marketing community and to collaborate with professional organisations to harness their networks of marketers and expertise in marketing for good. For example, we are working with The Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM) on how they may be able to lend support to our project.<br\/><br\/>James Sutton, acting chief executive, said &ldquo;What the team are doing at Pimp my Cause is a fine demonstration of how professional marketing can have a positive impact on society and we&rsquo;re keen to be able to support them in any way that we are able to. I look forward to discussing how this may take shape in the coming months&rdquo;<br\/><br\/>Many causes raise donations on the basis of passing virtually the full value of those donations directly on to their beneficiaries. Yet we understand that investment in the right marketing creates a multiplier effect, leading to a greater social impact. And this can be even more true when causes develop social enterprise models to drive their funding. In year two, we plan to look a lot more closely at how marketing can be used to multiply cause impact many times over and working to find new ways to build breakthrough cause marketing plans and access new ways of funding those plans.<br\/><br\/>Building on our <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/content/section/interviews\" target=\"_blank\">expert interview series</a>, where we bring in top experts like Doug Richard from the Dragon&rsquo;s Den to advise our causes, we plan to develop new initiatives to foster thought leadership in the subject of marketing as a force for good. We plan to go further in harnessing the intellectual capital of the marketing work achieved through Pimp My Cause and to developing new ways to share that knowledge and insight across the platform and the sector.<br\/><br\/>We also see great advantages for corporate marketing teams in collaborating with us and our causes. Working with our causes can lead to breakthrough opportunities for brand citizenship as well as increasing staff creativity, morale and community &ldquo;mind-share&rdquo;. Learning how to develop social and environmental benefits is increasingly relevant to the day-job. <br\/><br\/>One thing will not change in year two. Everything we do is built on the basis of collaboration. So if you think marketing can be a force for good and have some ideas of your own - why not get in touch?</p>"

We work to support individuals and communities in west and central London. Our vision is to help to establish strong and vibrant communities and to help to improve people&rsquo;s quality of life. Our community work focuses on five key areas:<br\/><br\/>*engaging with young people and children<br\/><br\/>* supporting vulnerable and older people<br\/><br\/>* helping with jobs and training<br\/><br\/>* involving the community<br\/><br\/>* advising on money and debt</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/octavia-foundation.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p><p><br\/><br\/>To achieve our ambitions means to actively engage with our community of beneficiaries, supporters, funders, charity shop customers and advocates. And to do that means getting really good at social media.<br\/><br\/>We had an old Facebook profile with around 500 &lsquo;likes&rsquo;. This page had a bit of personality, but it was lacking the professionalism that we wanted to convey. There were many places that we shared our news, stories from our charity shops, etc and we wanted to pull it all together in one place and begin to expand our online community. After having a look at the pages feature on Facebook I realised we&rsquo;d need a bit of help with the back end and went looking for help.<br\/><br\/>One of our fundraising supporters, Bethany Cox, recommended Pimp My Cause, so we joined and posted a help wanted advert.<br\/><br\/>We were very quickly contacted by <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/professionals/more_information/91\" target=\"_blank\">Jonathan Waddingham</a>, the Product Manager for <a href=\"http://www.justgiving.com/\" target=\"_blank\">JustGiving</a>. Jonathan was the perfect person to help. We were immediately impressed by Jonathan's level of experience and his senior position at JustGiving. He very quickly got down to work structuring the new page. After exchanging emails we met up at his office to talk through the project, he gave additional advice and installed the JustGiving app onto the new page. We greatly appreciated Jonathan's technical ability, understanding of social media and his readiness to give his time to our project. Many thanks to you Jonathan!<br\/><br\/>But our progress through Pimp My Cause did not end there. While we were working on the structure and content of the new Facebook page with Jonathan we were also contacted by Social Media expert <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/professionals/more_information/990\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Thomas</a> of <a href=\"http://www.blueeyeddigital.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Blue Eyed Digital</a> in Warwickshire. Michael and the design team at Blue Eyed Digital were able to help us with the design of the front end of the Facebook page. He really understood our work and objectives and was able to advise a number of activities to suit our (limited!) budget and resources.<br\/><br\/>Around this time Facebook changed their pages design to the new timeline model and Michael was able to advise us about the impact that the changes would have and amended the materials accordingly. Our page is now live and we&rsquo;re excited to see the positive impact that the redesign will have to engagement and support of the <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/OctaviaFoundation\" target=\"_blank\">charity on Facebook</a>.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/octavia1.png\" alt=\"\"/></p><p><br\/><br\/>I was so inspired by my experience working with Pimp My Cause volunteers that it gave me the confidence to become even more ambitious when seeking pro bono marketing support. The Octavia Foundation has pioneered the development of a new local credit union to make financial services available to low income families in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.<br\/><br\/>With the inspiration from Pimp My Cause I picked up the phone and made a few calls to local marketing agencies and was amazed at the response I received. Branding and graphic design was supplied pro-bono by <a href=\"http://www.avenuelondon.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Avenue Design</a>. Avenue are based on Portobello road, at the heart of the borough&rsquo;s creative community.

We felt we needed to take some time off deployment to update our systems and create a plan for the coming years to ensure that our growth would be sustainable. Today, six months later we are nearly finished writing our business plan, rebuilding our financial systems, and completing a marketing plan. We had no idea how challenging the planning process would be when we started.<br\/><br\/>We&rsquo;re used to being based overseas working with disaster survivors, not working in the office full time. Our move from front line to back office has been simultaneously enlightening and challenging. It&rsquo;s also been incredibly rewarding to take stock and look hard at all of our systems to create a road map for the next three years.<br\/><br\/>Roberta&rsquo;s task was to help us with the marketing section of that road map. Before working with Roberta, we had a strong sense of our target audiences, brand identity, and an intuitive understand of what we wanted to do, but without any formal training in marketing we were unable to articulate our needs and goals.<br\/><br\/>Without any kind of clear statement of our aims, we struggled to attract the kind of help we needed. Like many causes we were in a catch-22. We needed help, but we didn&rsquo;t know enough to ask for the right help or look for the right resources.<br\/><br\/>This is where individuals like Roberta come in handy. In our case, Roberta&rsquo;s first volunteer role through Pimp My Cause led her to apply for the Vodafone World of Difference Placement. In her placement, she&rsquo;s worked with us to develop a marketing plan which would clearly define our needs and allow us to recruit the volunteers and pro-bono support we&rsquo;ll need to continue growing.<br\/><br\/>Roberta&rsquo;s work with EDV doesn&rsquo;t write up very well in our newsletter &ndash; her planning work can't compete with photos of scholarship recipients with their report cards. In that way it&rsquo;s much the same as our long planning process. Without these investments in our infrastructure our projects would grind to a halt, yet donors don&rsquo;t want to fund central costs and supporters are less likely to engage with &ldquo;stories from the office.&rdquo;<br\/><br\/>Back office work on systems and infrastructure seems to be all of the guts but none of the glory. And so it comes as no surprise that volunteers like Roberta are hard to come by. Volunteers are less likely to put themselves forward for strategic planning work than to join us on deployment and get their hands dirty.<br\/><br\/>That&rsquo;s a shame, because when professionals connect with charities, their impacts are far reaching and hugely effective. Thanks to Roberta&rsquo;s work and the connections made possible by Pimp My Cause we have a series of well-defined aims and the knowhow to target specific opportunities and recruit the right volunteers to reach those goals. As we help survivors help themselves, so can professionals help charities help themselves &ndash; and that is surely a worthy aim.<br\/><br\/>Some key findings from our work with Roberta include:<br\/><br\/>1) While there are other organsiations like EDV, no other direct competitor combines our combination of professionalism, low cost, and inclusive volunteerism. However, our key differences are a bit complex, and represent a communications challenge. We are going to use more case studies, which will be better integrated throughout the website, to draw attention to our key strengths and how we're different from our competitors.<br\/><br\/>2) EDV doesn't currently collect enough demographic information with its donors and such and, as a result, struggles to send appropriately targeted communications. Improving this is a key priority which underpins all future activities.We plan to improve our database and collect more data when people sign up to volunteer or receive communications.<br\/><br\/>3) From what data we do have, EDV's core supporters are in the 16 - 20 age group. This is interesting, as this is the group least likely to give. We consider this both a strength - that we are engaging with a disengaged group - and a weakness - that we are not engaging enough with other donor groups. We plan to deepen our relationship with our young supports through encouraging advocacy on the part of EDV and work on attracting new supporters through advertising.<br\/><br\/>4) Our communications are limited by cost to online. This is not necessarily the end of the world, but as our website is hugely under-performing presents a key risk. Improvements to the website are another key priority.<br\/><br\/>We have greatly appreciated having Roberta's help during this key phase in our charity's development and we hope that more marketers feel inspired to use their talent to make a meaningful difference to a cause they can believe in.</p>"

  "content": "<h2>Great Marketing Puts Africa on the Ball</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Guest post by Andrew Jenkin, Trustee of <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/994\" target=\"_blank\">Africa on the Ball</a></p><p>Africa on the Ball is a non-profit organisation that uses the power of football for community development in deprived areas of Africa. We started in 2010 and have started and sponsored a team in Lusaka, Zambia for the past two years. And now Pimp My Cause marketing volunteers are helping us take things the next level!<br\/> <br\/> Our current situation is that we are sponsoring a team in the 6th tier of Zambian football. They are an Under 18s team that have been playing together for years. Through that team, situated in the compound of Kalingalinga, Lusaka, we are trying to develop the community by getting the boys on the team to help out around the community. They are entitled to apply for educational benefits such as tuition fees in exchange for managing an aspect of the community development scheme. For example, Mavuto Mbewe is now being sponsored to finish school (as he couldn&rsquo;t afford to finish it as both his parents died) by Elena through Africa on the Ball. In exchange, he will manage the Litter Picking duties around Kalingalinga and be responsible for that aspect of the project.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/africaontheball3.png\" alt=\"\"/></p><p><br\/> There are many benefits of purely having the team playing competitive football also, including the opportunity to educate them on life skills such as communication, leadership and team work. Although perhaps the most beneficial aspect of the team is that it gives teenagers at an age when they can become influenced to engage in drinking and drugs (which is rife in parts of Zambia at that age) a focus and a determination that if they can work hard, they can play professional football.<br\/> <br\/> We found out about Pimp My Cause by another organisation who had benefitted from the website, <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/132\" target=\"_blank\">High Five Club</a>.<br\/> <br\/> As a small organisation that is run in spare hours by two volunteers and little to no budget for marketing and assistance in media, we realised that we required help in order to help it develop it further. We wanted to meet people that shared our passion for development through sport in Africa that could offer practical skills we don't have.<br\/> <br\/> Although we hoped to generate some help through Pimp My Cause, we didn't expect to be benefitting to the extent we are. Not too long after signing upto the website, we were introduced to <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/professionals/more_information/1134\" target=\"_blank\">Sevil Ozer Crespo</a> from <a href=\"http://mavdig.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Maverick</a>. Maverick and Sevil have been extremely generous to us, offering to completely re-develop our website to bring a new appeal to the organisation. After extensive researching into our aims, objectives, goals and values - they've just started the design and we are so excited to see what they come up with.<br\/> <br\/> We also met <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/professionals/more_information/1379\" target=\"_blank\">Matt Tutt</a> on Pimp My Cause. Matt has also been extremely generous and offered to not only be our Online Fundraising Officer, but helped advertised our site on his website and will develop a Facebook app to increase awareness of the organisation and bring attention to the boys on the team who could benefit from sponsoring to go back to school.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/africaontheballkits.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p><p><br\/> <br\/> These projects are massive to the development of Africa on the Ball. For an organisation to develop in the way it will thanks to Sevil (and Maverick) and Matt, would cost a small fortune in money we'd rather be spending in Africa on the cause. Pimp My Cause will successfully be crucial to our sustainable development as an organisation, which in turn will help us extend our reach in Africa.<br\/> <br\/> We'd like to thank Anna from Pimp My Cause, Sevil from Maverick and Matt Tutt for all their help. We've benefitted greatly from all our their work and without them wouldn't be able to develop our plans in Africa.</p>"

The result was a bright and eye-catching billboard with a simple message and call to action - we loved working with Michelle and were delighted with the finished product.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/sos_billboard.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p><p>We have lots more ideas to raise awareness of the cause and our work to create a brighter future for orangutans - particularly using online messaging, e-commerce, and working with schools.

We are speaking to them today because they have recently had some very successful films in the Charity sector that are connecting messages to audiences in a different and unique way and because we are collaborating with them to offer a pro bono film competition to our member causes.</strong><br\/><br\/><strong>Can you briefly introduce yourselves?</strong><br\/><br\/>Stephen Follows: Hi, I&rsquo;m Stephen. I&rsquo;m a writer and producer. In the past I&rsquo;ve produced a couple of feature films, a few web series, some radio comedy and a bunch of other film projects. My writing started slowly and so by trade I tend to refer to myself as a producer although the writing side is far more fun!<br\/><br\/>Ed Dark: I'm Ed and I&rsquo;m a director. Stephen teases me that I try to push everything one step bigger, further or better. It all started when I made a short film a few years ago and I decided to shoot it on IMAX rather than a more normal format. The film was called 'Chasing Cotards', it starred Andrew Scott (Moriarty in BBC's 'Sherlock') and it did quite well. Before becoming a full-time director I worked on numerous Hollywood productions ('Inkheart', 'Harry Potter' series) and BBC Drama.<br\/><br\/>Stephen: I&rsquo;ve never said your drive to make everything bigger is wrong, just funny.<br\/><br\/>Ed: True. More recently we&rsquo;ve been working together to focus on videos for the charity sector.<br\/><br\/>Stephen: Because of our background in narrative film we focus on stories and characters rather than marketing slogans or flashy concepts. And this is what viewers want from video online. We feel quite fortunate that we&rsquo;ve come into the sector just as everyone is seeing the power of online video.<br\/><br\/><strong>Paul: Why should a charity consider using online video?</strong><br\/><br\/>Ed: It is the most powerful communication method in making people care, beyond directly talking to people one at a time. It&rsquo;s easier to motivate people using a video than a poster campaign, direct mail, radio and email.<br\/><br\/>Stephen: If you&rsquo;re comparing it to television advertising then it&rsquo;s a no-brainer! The production costs are normally much less and it costs almost nothing to get it out there. Last year we worked with a client who spent &pound;&frac12; million pounds making a TV advert and then &pound;10 million broadcasting it. And now that campaign is over his ads don&rsquo;t run anymore. With online video your work is there for as long as the internet exists. They live forever.<br\/><br\/><strong>Paul: Why do you say it connects better than other media forms?</strong><br\/><br\/>Stephen: When you watch a video that doesn&rsquo;t appear to be a campaign film then you&rsquo;re watching it as a form of entertainment. It feels like a movie or TV. Your guard is down and you&rsquo;re willing to watch. If you receive a leaflet through the door giving you a list of facts about a cause (a) you may not read it as you instantly regard it as boring and (b) you immediately have your emotional guard up.<br\/><br\/>Ed: The Internet is full of millions of people looking for a distraction from what they should be doing. Charities can harness this to grab people&rsquo;s attention and then to use it to make people truly care about the message/cause.<br\/><br\/><strong>Paul: What&rsquo;s the trick to getting lots of views for a video?</strong><br\/><br\/>Ed: Make a good video. (laughs)<br\/><br\/>Although there are ways to &lsquo;buy&rsquo; views they are a huge waste of money and usually don&rsquo;t achieve the aim of the campaign. It&rsquo;s not about having x number of people view your video its about people genuinely connecting with your message and taking whatever action you want them to take.<br\/><br\/>Stephen: The point of what we do is not the video; it&rsquo;s the result &ndash; the communication of the message and the call to action.<br\/><br\/><strong>Paul: Do you have to do lots of work sharing the video?</strong><br\/><br\/>Stephen: Yes and no. Of course it helps if you have links with journalists, bloggers and people sympathetic to your cause. But at the end of the day you should be putting your focus in making something people want to watch. That&rsquo;s the only way of truly breaking out of your existing circle of supporters and reaching new people.<br\/><br\/>Ed: When you&rsquo;ve enjoyed watching a video you want to share it. It&rsquo;s like retelling a joke you&rsquo;ve just heard &ndash; suddenly you&rsquo;re funny! The internet has a whole array of ways people can share something they like from Facebook and Twitter to blogs and email.<br\/><br\/><strong>Paul: Give us an example.</strong><br\/><br\/>Stephen: We recently worked with &lsquo;Friends Of The Earth&rsquo; who asked us to make people to want to recycle. So we made a two minute love story between two milk cartons.<br\/><br\/>Ed: Obviously.<br\/><br\/>Stephen: (laughs) Exactly. When people come to watch it they are not expecting it to be a campaign film. By the time they reach the end of the video they have a strong emotional connection to recycling.<br\/><br\/>Ed: The film has been a huge success for &lsquo;Friends of the Earth&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s had over 1 million views online, won various awards and was even tweeted about by Stephen Fry.<br\/><br\/>The end result is that audiences all over the world are emotionally connecting with recycling and this was our brief.<br\/><br\/>You can watch the film here:</p><p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/MRt4lEXkDJs\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe><br\/><br\/><strong>Paul: What is the most important thing a charity can do when planning a video?</strong><br\/><br\/>Stephen: Know why they&rsquo;re doing it. What&rsquo;s success and what&rsquo;s failure?<br\/><br\/>Ed: If your plan is &lsquo;to make a video&rsquo; I can guarantee you&rsquo;ll achieve it! But what&rsquo;s the point in that? You need to have a defined, measurable objective.<br\/><br\/>Stephen: Otherwise how can you tell during the process if you&rsquo;re making the right video or not?<br\/><br\/><strong>Paul: What sort of budgets do you work with for these videos? Because they look like they would be very expensive (a luxury not all charities can afford)</strong><br\/><br\/>Ed: It definitely costs less that you think! However, it all depends on the video and the campaign we are trying to get across to the audience. For example: you could have 3 helicopters fighting in the middle of a war zone and that would cost close to &pound;500, 000, or you could have a monologue by a great actor to camera in one room and that would cost close to &pound;500. What we ask the Charity to do is tell us early on how much money they have allocated for the video. That way we know what limitations we are working with &ndash; we will then create a brief that works with that budget in mind.<br\/><br\/><strong>Paul: Why do charity videos fail?</strong><br\/><br\/>Ed: They&rsquo;re boring.<br\/><br\/>Stephen: And they only appeal to current supporters who already agree with you. It&rsquo;s a waste of money to use a video to try and convince to those people &ndash; they already agree and you already have their email addresses!<br\/><br\/><strong>Paul: Many charity videos seem to use shocking or nasty imagery but you don&rsquo;t. Why</strong><strong> not?</strong><br\/><br\/>Stephen: I completely understand why some charities go straight for shock &ndash; their causes are shocking. But it doesn&rsquo;t automatically follow that the best way of converting new audiences to your cause it to shock them. If you can inspire people they will connect with you on a deeper level that shock can ever achieve.<br\/><br\/>Ed: When was the last time you shared a video about a boy being abused or a girl being raped? I never have because I know my friends won&rsquo;t want to see that on my Twitter or Facebook page. What they will want to see is a video that connects with them emotionally.<br\/><br\/><strong>Paul: Even for a topic that can be pretty brutal, like Road Safety?</strong><br\/><br\/>Stephen: Google &lsquo;Embrace Life&rsquo;. 15 million views and it makes me feel amazing every time I watch it. Not a shattered limb in sight!<br\/><br\/><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/h-8PBx7isoM\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe><br\/><br\/>Ed: I love that video.<br\/><br\/><strong>Paul: At this point in our interviews we usually ask our guests to pick one of our member causes and give them some advice or ideas - but you are going to do much more than that - would you like to share the plan with our readers?</strong><br\/><br\/>Ed: Yes, we're looking forward to this one!<br\/><br\/>Stephen: We're going to make a video for an organisation via Pimp My Cause for free.<br\/><br\/>Paul: Totally for free?<br\/><br\/>Stephen: As much as we can. We'll work entirely pro bono and the company won't take any payment/overhead, although there may be some minor external costs according to what the cause wants to see happen in the film. These costs can include things like props that will be featured in the film - they will be agreed in advance and we'll do our best to minimize them as much as possible.<br\/><br\/>We always write to a brief so if part of that brief is a budget of almost nothing then we'll make sure our ideas are appropriate. Obviously the more money we have to play with the more creative possibilities open to us and the further the video is likely to travel.<br\/><br\/>There is an application form where we ask people what their budget is for the film would be (under &pound;500, &pound;500-&pound;1,000 or above &pound;1,000) but this won't affect the selection process. We'll be picking the winning idea based on need and how much of an impact a video can have. We just need to know the budget range so we can create relevant ideas.<br\/><br\/><strong>Paul: So how can our member causes apply?</strong><br\/><br\/>Stephen: Fill in the <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/OnlineVideoCompetition2012_ApplicationForm.doc\" target=\"_blank\">application form here</a> and make sure it gets to us as soon as possible (email it to info@pimpmycause.org). The final deadline is the 21st of September, but the sooner applications come in the better the chance they will have as it gives us longer to develop ideas for the,.<br\/><br\/>Ed: We're looking for which organisation has the most compelling need for a video. So this might be linked to a particular upcoming campaign, to combat current misconceptions or to introduce themselves to a younger, more internet- savey audience. Don't worry about how hard the brief is &ndash; that's something we're good at. The harder the brief, the tougher the problem, the better!<br\/><br\/>You can see more of Catsnake&rsquo;s work at their website:<br\/><a href=\"http://www.catsnake.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><br\/>www.catsnake.com</a></p>"

It has given our sanctuary a new lease of life, opening up opportunities that we had not considered or were wary of before.<br\/> <br\/> <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/1315\" target=\"_blank\">Lakeview Monkey Sanctuary</a> was created to provide a home for rescued primates to give them a home for life. We have been rescuing monkeys for over 25 years now and in this time we have been able to help these wonderful creatures live the way they should, with other monkeys, sometimes for the first time in their lives. Our mission statement is to 'rescue, re-home and rehabilitate' &nbsp;and to achieve this, we travel throughout the UK to rescue the monkeys, whilst also working alongside international organisations to bring primates in need to our sanctuary.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/bacillusk.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/cutemonkey.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/><br\/> <br\/> The majority of monkeys we rescue have come through the primate pet trade. Some have lived in isolation for over 20 years which has led to them being both physically and psychologically damaged. We try to repair this damage, which can take many months or even years, unfortunately though, the physical damage can be so severe that they never fully recover, which can be heart breaking.<br\/> <br\/> The other monkeys we rescue, are from the entertainment world i.e. circus' and laboratories and the occasional zoo animal. All have various needs which have to be addressed and the most wonderful part of the whole process, is seeing a monkey who has never lived with another primate its whole life, interact for the first time. To see their reaction when they touch, groom and hold each other, makes us cry every time!<br\/> <br\/> The next phase of our sanctuary mission, is to develop our 10 acres of woodland into large enclosures for groups of monkeys. The vast majority arrive alone and to create a natural social dynamic for them, we are busy building their new homes. We have an exciting time ahead for the monkeys and us!</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/lakemonkey.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/><br\/> <br\/> To achieve all of our goals we knew we needed professional marketing support, so when Pimp My Cause was recommended to us by a colleague in the animal world we were thrilled to be able to create a profile and help wanted adverts.<br\/> <br\/> The marketing needs of the sanctuary were: how do we raise our profile and create income but keep our privacy and security. We also needed to create a logo.<br\/> <br\/> <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/professionals/more_information/1244\" target=\"_blank\">Trevor Isherwood</a>, owner of Redpine Marketing Ltd, answered our posted advert within a couple of days which was incredible. Via email, we exchanged thoughts and then had a long conversation by phone (Trevor rang us) so he could understand our needs, get a feel for us and how we liked to do things and put a plan in place.<br\/> <br\/> Trevor then sent us a presentation incorporating all we had discussed and quite a few logo ideas attached too. He volunteered to undertake the set up of social media, re-vamp our adoption process, create a logo and look at diversified income streams, all without compromising our wish to remain closed to the public. Trevor &nbsp;understood our reasons for remaining closed ie we are a sanctuary and our monkeys deserve peace and tranquility, and pitched his ideas in a way that would be on our terms.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/lms_logo_copy.jpg\" alt=\"New logo created by pro bono marketer\"\/></p><p><em>New logo created by Redpine Marketing Ltd</em></p><p><br\/> We are delighted with the help that Trevor and Redpine have given us.

  "content": "<h2>How Participatory Marketing Can Fund Sustainable Farms</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Small sustainable farms are a valuable environmental and cultural resource, but they are notoriously difficult to fund. Rossi Mitova has come up with a way for everyone who cares to help fund small farms through the soon to be launched interactive website farmhopping.com. Pimp My Cause marketing volunteer <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/professionals/more_information/1247\" target=\"_blank\">Edwina Mullins</a> is helping Rossi and her team take the project global and reach more farmers and farming advocates all over the world.</p><p><br\/> The project came about after Rossi graduated from university in London with a degree in investment and financial risk management. She heard from her friend Mihail about his incredible experience on a sustainable farm in Bulgaria. He was greatly impressed with their rare breed livestock, which are important to the local ecosystem, but much more expensive to care for. Mihail wanted to do a small part to help support the farm so he offered to buy a few of the Karakachan Sheep and long haired mountain goats to help with the costs and to have a stake in the farm. He enjoyed visiting his animals and receiving some of the farms produce.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/goats.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><br\/> <br\/> This triggered an idea for Rossi, why not create a system so that more people who care about small sustainable farms can have a stake in an actual farm, learn from the farmers, maybe even visit and enjoy the products made on the farm. And so <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/1192\" target=\"_blank\">farmhopping</a> was born, an online platform to connect farmers with advocates. The website will allow users to interact with real farms all over the world. They can 'purchase' animals and the money will go towards the cost of running that farm and the users in turn can visit their farms, receive produce from them, learn about the farming methods, culture and lifestyle of the farmers.<br\/> <br\/> \"You can own a sheep in India, a goat in Israel or a cow in Bulgaria,\" Rossi explains. \"This is a platform for people who recognise the environmental and social importance of small farms and want to do their part to support them. If users enjoy travel they can visit their farms, enjoy the produce, help care for the animals, learn about new lifestyles, cultures and farming methods and have a fun experience.\"<br\/> <br\/> Rossi is hoping that the project will stimulate new farms to turn to more sustainable farming practices such as raising endangered livestock species and organic production, which would otherwise be too expensive for the farm to maintain. It will also help to raise ecological awareness amongst consumers, teach them about farming and sustainable practices.<br\/><br\/><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/farmhopping.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/></p><p><br\/> farmhopping has big ideas so they needed the marketing support to make their ideas a reality. After hearing about Pimp My Cause from the <em>People Who Share</em> they posted an advert asking for marketing help and were contacted by Edwina Mullins. Edwina's digital marketing experience in the agricultural sector was a perfect fit for having the sector knowledge and contacts to help farmhopping.<br\/> <br\/> farmhopping has a fairly complicated model, the challenge was to merge education, charity work, travel and getting free stuff into one coherent message. Edwina took the time to fully understand their ideas and help them decide on the best marketing channels. She has created a roll out marketing plan for the website's launch and is currently developing an overall marketing strategy.<br\/> <br\/> She has helped them answer difficult questions such as 'who is our target market?', 'should we be looking for marketing support through existing charities and NGO's?' and 'should we focus on local farms or go global?'.<br\/> <br\/> Edwina has brought in colleagues and friends to help on the project and has helped to identify and contact potential farms around the world to build the network of small sustainable farms. Rossi knows that they are extremely lucky to have found a marketer with the right skills and passion to help them take this ambitious and unique project forward. Rossi is hoping Edwina will come visit their first partner farm, Perun, located in an environmentally projected area of Bugaria in October to enjoy the full farmhopping experience for herself.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/farm.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/goats2.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/><br\/> <br\/> The <a href=\"http://www.farmhopping.com/\" target=\"_blank\">farmhopping website</a> is currently under construction, the informational website will be up in October with the full website launch coming soon.<br\/> <br\/> farmhopping is still in need of <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/projects/details/337\" target=\"_blank\">web development support</a>, so if any developers would like to give some time to the project, please get in touch.<br\/> <br\/> It's a fantastic idea and we look forward to seeing how the farmhopping network grows in the coming years.</p>"

The <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/955\" target=\"_blank\">Oxford Real Farming Conference</a> exists to support those who are tackling this often ignored issue. And with the help of marketing volunteer <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/professionals/more_information/1255\" target=\"_blank\">Aliya Beissova</a>, the Oxford Real Farming Conference is inspiring farmers with a vision of enlightened farming.<br\/><br\/> The Oxford Real Farming Conference (ORFC) began in 2010 as a gathering of farmers, researchers, writers and those who love good food: people interested in providing high quality food without destroying the environment in the process. Each year the conference overlaps with the Oxford Farming Conference, an annual meeting of the agricultural establishment that exists largely to maintain the status quo: large scale, intensive, fossil fuel dependent agriculture for trade on the global market.<br\/> <br\/>The ORFC offers an alternative vision of farming designed to feed the world without also destroying it. The focus is on small-scale non-intensive farms providing locally produced food where possible. The Conference brings together large numbers of people who are already fulfilling this vision with others with varying degrees of practical, hands-on experience.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/orfc12.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/><br\/><em>Above is the ORFC 2012 website, see the image below of the new improved 2013 website.</em></p><p><em><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/orfc13.png\" alt=\"\"/><br\/></em><em>Above is the ORFC 2013 website, showing their strong new branding.</em><br\/><em><br\/></em>For the 4th Conference in January 2013, the team wanted to raise the profile of the event. In particular one aim was to attract more farmers and give them a glimpse of what enlightened agriculture could offer them. This where Pimp My Cause and Aliya Beissova came in. Aliya&rsquo;s marketing experience was vital when launching the new ORFC website, designed to put across the ORFC&rsquo;s message to the online world. Aliya helped produce a site map and design brief which was then presented to a designer. She also helped with search engine optimisation and social media.<br\/><br\/>Aliya helped pin down the target audience for the conference and the message that the team wanted to express. She also helped come up with ideas for a branding theme that would communicate the ideas and concepts encapsulated by real farming. Her help was invaluable in offering a marketing perspective and encouraging the organisers to think in terms of brands and promotion, which is vital for the aim or reaching out to new participants. The website is up now: <a href=\"http://www.oxfordrealfarmingconference.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.oxfordrealfarmingconference.org</a> and Aliya is continuing to work with the ORFC team to develop and increase an online presence in the build-up to the conference.</p>"

The new project required recruiting volunteers to promote home fire safety messages and identify those that might need referring to the Fire Service for a home fire safety check. They were disappointed with the response they were getting from their volunteer recruitment materials, so when their community advisor, Ed Aniskowicz, learned of Pimp My Cause through a third sector newsletter, they signed up to find a marketer to help.

Though we are not sure 'competition' is the right word to describe this initiative since it was not about picking the 'best' cause rather, we tried to identity the cause that we could help the most. So here are a few words from top filmmakers <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/content/information/interviews/a-conversation-with-catsnake\" target=\"_blank\">Catsnake</a> about the selection process and hints about the winning film to come! We want to thank all of you who applied for the competition, we appreciate the work that went into your applications. And thank you to Catsnake for taking on this ambitious pro bono project - we look forward to viewing and helping to promote the winning film.<br\/><br\/><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/cat.png\" alt=\"\"/></p><p>So over to Stephen Fellows from Catsnake to give their perspective on the selection process and to announce the winner...</p><p><strong>Stephen:<br\/></strong></p><p>Phew, that was quite a mission! <br\/><br\/>When we opened our competition to win a pro bono video we weren&rsquo;t expecting quite so many applications. We received entries from a wide variety of organisations from one-person single-cause operations to national well-known names.<br\/> <br\/>We approached the challenge of whittling it down to the final three quite seriously. We looked at two main areas &ndash; the Cause and the Need. <br\/><br\/>The Cause related to the organisation and what they campaign for/against. Did we regard their cause as one in particular need of attention? Is this something we feel able to relate to? Inevitably we found ourselves weighing up the merits of one special interest group over another &ndash; never an easy task when the gamut of entries came from parties looking after the interests of the young, the old, the sick, the infirm, the handicapped, the poor, the hungry and plants!<br\/> <br\/>The Need looked at to what degree a web video would be of use to the organisation. In our opinion, some very worthy causes would not benefit much from having a new video online. We strongly believe that online video holds a power to move and motivate but even we acknowledge that it cannot solve all the world&rsquo;s ills. We want to be making tangible difference with our video for this competition so we placed a lot of importance on the need.<br\/> <br\/>The quality of applications varied hugely. A few seemed to be last-minute rush jobs but the majority seemed to be well researched and carefully put together. In the world of film we do not often need to make formal applications for grants and so are not as familiar as the charity sector is generally in form-filling. We got the sense that some applications were written by professionals long-experienced with tackling written applications. Much of my job as a writer is to find the emotional way of expressing a thought so I took some professional pleasure in seeing such well-written answers. (That said, I would hope that the quality of the prose had no bearing on our decision-making process &ndash; we tried to stick religiously to the Cause and the Need criteria laid out above).<br\/> <br\/>In reading the applications it was interesting to see who the main point of contact was. &nbsp;In some cases the Chief Operating Officer would be listed as the contact whereas others had the Assistant Press Officer. Obviously this had absolutely no bearing on our process but it did give a little insight into each entrant. With a small group it&rsquo;s unsurprising that just a few people will take on many roles.<br\/> <br\/>We managed to create a long-list of seven, which, after much agonising analysis, gave way to a shortlist of three &ndash; <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/1429\" target=\"_blank\">Full Circle</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/1175\" target=\"_blank\">SHP</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/711\" target=\"_blank\">ChiLD Lung Foundation</a>. We met with the three organisations &ndash; all of whom were fantastic &ndash; and then spent time brainstorming what a video for each would be like. In the end we felt that the organisation for whom we could do the most for was SHP. &nbsp;They deal with a problem that is close to our hearts; homelessness in London. We live and work in London and so initially felt like we understood the problem. But after speaking with Dave and Katie from SHP we came to understand that the problem of &lsquo;homelessness&rsquo; is not as simple as its most visible symptoms. SHP also work with what could be called the &lsquo;invisible homeless&rsquo;; i.e. people moving who don&rsquo;t have a permanent home but whom find some shelter in hostels. SHP also work with people once they have left the streets in order to help their rehabilitation and re-entry into &lsquo;normal&rsquo; life.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/scaled-524134754-shplogosmalljpg.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><br\/> <br\/>Our film for SHP will use the Christmas period as a backdrop to highlight the effect SHP have for those most at need. We&rsquo;ll be revealing more about the film in forthcoming blog entries.<br\/><br\/>We would like to offer our deepest thanks to everyone who applied and our profound apologies that we needed to select just one winner. Given the right resources we would currently be embarking on about twenty new pro bono videos!</p>"

Two important tasks ahead of them are making their case to GP's of the importance of postnatal depression support and finding sustainable long term funding. To succeed with both of these tasks MumsAid knew that they needed a professional website to back up their experience and expertise in working with struggling mothers.<br\/><br\/>\"We are committed to removing the barriers which often prevent women seeking help by challenging the stigma that surrounds postnatal depression and by raising awareness about the symptoms, impact and treatment,\" explains MumsAid founder and Clinical Director, Miriam Donaghy.

And She oversees MumsAid's committed and experienced volunteer counsellors and psychotherapists currently providing free counselling to new mums at four children's centres in Greenwich.<br\/><br\/>MumsAid is providing a great service for struggling new mums, but they needed to reach more individuals, doctors and potential funding sources. UnLtd suggested that Miriam sign up for Pimp My Cause to see if she could get pro bono support in building the MumsAid website.<br\/><br\/>In September Miriam connected with <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/professionals/more_information/1198\" target=\"_blank\">Bek Cruddace</a>, an experienced graphic designer and web developer on the Pimp My Cause platform.

Over the next couple of months they worked together to create a clear and inspiring site that shares the important work that MumsAid is doing.<br\/><br\/>Miriam was very pleased with the outcome: \"I love the website that Bek has created for MumsAid and the feedback about it from users and colleagues has been very positive. I found Bek incredibly helpful throughout the design process. She made useful suggestions, translated everything into non techy language and was very patient with all my requests for tweaks. She also managed to deliver the finished working design in an impressively quick time frame.\"<br\/><br\/>Now that they have a great website, MumsAid's next task is to connect with more mums through social media and they would love to hear from any marketers wanting to help them develop their social media marketing strategy.<br\/><br\/></p>"

I knew that it had to be a fun organization. And after learning more about them I'm even more impressed by their positive, take charge attitude. They have built a website that makes the lives of disabled and life-limited children easier and more enjoyable. It brings all of the resources needed by their parents together into a reassuring and accessible site. And behind the site are many volunteers researching and answering the questions of their users.</p><p><img title=\"Marketing volunteer helps drive traffic to Sky Badger\" src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/skybadger.jpeg\" alt=\"Sky Badger receives pro bono marketing support\"\/><br\/><br\/>Naomi Marek, Chief Executive of Sky Badger summed it up nicely by saying, \"we believe that family life should be full of fun and adventure &ndash; this is especially important when your child has a disability or life threatening illness. For the parents of disabled children, Sky Badger is a one-stop-shop: the easiest place to find out about all of the help that&rsquo;s available in the UK.\"<br\/><br\/>And they have plans to expand their site to include micro offerings like small local classes. This new project will require a lot of time and effort to research the available options and keep the site updated. They are starting with the East of England and expanding over time. They will be training young people with learning difficulties to take on the copy writing, researching and data entry for the new project.<br\/><br\/>Like many of our causes Sky Badger has been given a google adwords grant to help bring traffic to their website. But also like many of our causes they initially found it difficult to set up and manage their adwords account. And as their funds are very limited and they had no marketing budget to help families with disabled children find them, it was particularly important for them to use their grant efficiently.<br\/><br\/>Naomi found Pimp My Cause through her own google searching and posted an appeal for support with their adwords campaign.

  "content": "<h2>Twelve, a Winning Film by Catsnake</h2><p><br\/>Last month we announced London homelessness charity SHP as the winner of <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/content/information/blog/announcing-the-winner-of-the-pro-bono-film-by-catsnake\" target=\"_blank\">our competition to win a pro bono film</a> from top <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/content/information/interviews/a-conversation-with-catsnake\" target=\"_blank\">film makers Catsnake</a> and only six weeks later their film is being launched today to drive their Christmas appeal.<br\/><br\/>In just one minute the film takes us on a journey through the London streets, which brings out a bewildering mix of emotions as we share twelve months of homelessness with Jez (the hero). Set to an original score based on 'The Twelve Days of Christmas' experienced actor Jethro Skinner (currently performing in <a href=\"http://www.londontheatredirect.com/play/764/Twelfth-Night-tickets.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Twelfth Night</a> with Stephen Fry at London's Apollo Theatre) makes the character 'Jez' come to life. The creativity and depth that filmmakers Stephen Follows and Ed Dark bring to their work is amazing.</p><p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Bmv65ZBRZyc\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe><br\/><br\/>If you enjoyed watching this beautiful Christmas story, do your part to prevent homelessness by <a href=\"http://www.shp.org.uk/twelve\">sharing the film with 12 friends, donating &pound;12 or signing up for 12 updates a year</a>. And check out <a href=\"http://www.shp.org.uk/twelve/stories/12monthsofdrinking\" target=\"_blank\">SHP's website</a> to read the back stories that inspired this film.<br\/><br\/><strong>Dave Titmas Communications Manager of SHP shares their experience of winning the film competition and working with Catsnake:</strong><br\/><br\/>We entered the film competition because we were impressed by Catsnake&rsquo;s ability to tell stories which engage and move people. If they could have half the office weeping over <a href=\"http://www.catsnake.com/friendsoftheearth/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">a love story between two milk bottles</a>, we were sure they could help us tell powerful stories about homelessness and recovery.<br\/>&nbsp;<br\/>Our aim was to produce a compelling film to form the centrepiece of a Christmas appeal &ndash; something that would engage viewers and encourage them to be sympathetic to our cause.<br\/><br\/>The short film re-writes a traditional Christmas song to reflect twelve moments in Jez&rsquo;s journey from homelessness to recovery. Each of the &lsquo;moments&rsquo; is drawn from a series of interviews with our clients, so every step of Jez&rsquo;s journey is shared by many of the people we support. We are linking each moment back to a corresponding interview, and drawing out more of the work SHP does in each area. &lsquo;Twelve&rsquo; is going to play a big part in the way we present the material!<br\/><br\/>Walter was one of the peer mentors helping Jez through his recovery in the film - a job he knows well since he is an active peer mentor for Camden Aftercare clients. Walter said: &ldquo;I was nervous at first when they said &lsquo;cameras are rolling,&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t expect that, but it was really good. I calmed down and the film crew did their job and we did ours (as peer mentors). I was trying to get Jethro (the actor) to identify with his role and his emotions, just like I would in any other peer meeting.&rdquo;<br\/><br\/>It has been wonderful to work with Catsnake. We were expecting Ed and Stephen to be full of creativity and ideas, but it was their attention to detail that was staggering &ndash; from lining up the shots with the utmost precision, to drawing on their own personal experiences to produce a fantastic character profile. It was humbling to have a team of such talented people give up their time to promote our cause.</p><p><img title=\"Catsnake team filming SHP video\" src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/filmingshp.jpeg\" alt=\"Pro bono film creation\"\/></p><p><br\/><strong>Ed Dark, Director at Catsnake shares his motives for making this film:</strong><br\/><br\/>I jumped at the chance to direct a pro bono film for SHP is because I have had some very close friends who have suffered from homelessness. I had friends who I didn't even realise were homeless and it has always upset me to think they were struggling to get through every day without any help. SHP is a wonderful charity that helps these people. I really felt that we could make a difference with this video by making the public realise that a person's life can be completely turned around with the help of SHP. It's extremely important that people help support SHP and everything they do.<br\/><br\/>Because of the nature of the subject we were able to secure one of our favourite actors (Jethro Skinner) and work with nearly all of our favourite crew. This is a testament to how everyone really got behind the powerful message we were trying to tell. The results are on the screen and I think we can all be extremely proud of our work.<br\/>&nbsp;<br\/><strong>Jethro Skinner, lead actor shares his motivation for supporting this project:</strong><br\/><br\/>I have spent a lot of time sharing the streets with the dispossessed and down on their luck and am often struck by their decency, humanity and misfortune. I despair at this country's unwillingness to support, care and love those whose circumstances have led them to desperate times.<br\/><br\/><strong>The importance of SHP's work:</strong><br\/><br\/>With unemployment and living costs rising more people are finding themselves in need of support to prevent homelessness.<br\/><br\/>Every year SHP helps 6,000 people rebuild their lives. Despite their efforts homelessness has risen by 35% in the last three years. You can help turn the tide by supporting the <a href=\"http://www.shp.org.uk/twelve\" target=\"_blank\">Twelve campaign</a>.<br\/><br\/></p>"

Ceri got in touch shortly after joining Pimp My Cause and she has been providing useful advice about using social media effectively.

Palm oil is an ingredient found in up to half of processed foods, as well as being used in cosmetics and as a biofuel, and the palm oil industry is responsible for the destruction of huge areas of forest in Sumatra and Borneo. Creating even more demand for palm oil by burning it to generate electricity would be very bad news for orangutans, rainforests, local people and the climate, and what's worse, it will be funded through our fuel bills. We are asking people to sign a petition, but also to contact their MPs about this issue. We have all the information and template letters on our website (see STOPtheROCs.org) - it's essential that the government realises that people do not want their fuel bills to subsidise the destruction of rainforests.<br\/><br\/><strong>Q: How did you conceive of the film idea?</strong><br\/>A: We knew that a decision was coming up about the government&rsquo;s proposals, and we were thinking of ways to spread the word and get people engaged and outraged. The Apollo 440 track 'Stop the Rock' came on the radio, and it was a eureka moment! The subsidies we're trying to stop are called Renewables Obligation Certificates, or ROCs, and the track really grabs your attention, making the film memorable.<br\/><br\/><strong>Q: How did you get John Griffith involved in the project?</strong><br\/>A: I sent John a message through Pimp My Cause letting him know what we wanted to accomplish and asking if he would be willing to use his skills to help us fulfill our vision. John was happy to support our film idea and he took on pretty much every aspect of the project, including the soundtrack and voice-over, and we are absolutely delighted with the result.<br\/><br\/><strong>Q: Where did the beautiful photos used in the film come from?</strong><br\/>A: Many of the images in the film are from rescues our team in Sumatra have conducted to help orangutans that were in danger as palm oil plantations expand into forests. A lot of the images were donated by fantastic wildlife photographers who want their pictures to be used to raise awareness of what we're losing. Sumatran orangutans could be the first Great Ape to go extinct if we don't take action now to protect their rainforest home. Increased demand for palm oil is leading to more and more deforestation - and it's just madness because, as if the impact on critically endangered species and local people wasn't bad enough, burning palm oil for energy is worse for the climate than fossil fuels - it doesn't make sense on any level.<br\/><br\/>The Sumatran Orangutan Society works to protect orangutans, their forests and their future. They do this by raising awareness about the importance of protecting orangutans and their rainforest home; supporting grassroots projects that empower local people to become guardians of the rainforests and restoring damaged orangutan habitat through tree planting programmes, and campaigning on issues threatening the survival of orangutans in the wild.</p>"

We have a pivotal role to play and may I add, that we, as the communications industry, have helped build and set in motion the wagon of consumerism and capitalism that is now driving us towards the edge of the cliff.</p><p>We can solve these worldwide problems in a responsible, sustainable and engaging way. Not only do we know the market and the consumers, but we also have an abundance of skills. We've built brands stronger than nations. We have convinced people that they can&rsquo;t live without buying a razor with an additional blade every single year, something they were blissfully unaware of until we told them their lives would be incomplete without it. We have built powerful relationships with every little boy and girl from Copenhagen to Cape Town, so that they can tell you why brand X is better than brand Y. It&rsquo;s time that we stand up as professionals and dare to put our talents to good use. After all, we are no better than the messages we put out there to our loved ones, our children, our friends and our fellow global citizens.</p><p><strong>Paul: Many of our member causes at Pimp My Cause have big ambitions but next to no marketing budget &ndash; what are your favourite campaigns from your book that harnessed the power of creative ideas without the need for much marketing spend?</strong></p><p>Thomas: It&rsquo;s never about the budget. It&rsquo;s always about the idea. The right idea can supersede any money spent on marketing. As the competition between causes for people&rsquo;s attention becomes fiercer, it&rsquo;s never been more important to stand out.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t want to choose one campaign over another, but let me give an example of a campaign I featured in Goodvertising; one I feel really grabs people&rsquo;s attention. The project by American director Jason Zada, is a personal project that encourages people to think twice about their privacy online. The interactive online experience, an app, called &ldquo;Take This Lollipop&rdquo; had 300,000 users within the first 24 hours of the campaign going live. Within just 30 days, 10 million people had liked the app- making it one of Facebook&rsquo;s fastest growing apps of all time. As of the beginning of 2013, over 100 million people had interacted with the video &ndash; clearly illustrating the power of a strong idea. This just shows that if you as a cause want to succeed, you have to either internally prioritize a culture where ideas are encouraged or partner with communication companies that are idea centric.</p><p><strong>Paul: As you illustrate in the book, a new media environment creates innumerable opportunities for engaging content such as viral videos &ndash; but this often means causes have to find ways to &ldquo;market their marketing&rdquo; to get online attention &ndash; what are the best ways to make the most out of good creative content with little marketing spend?</strong></p><p>Thomas: Yes, it is true that initially it appears as if the new media landscape offers unprecedented possibilities for causes- and as we in the last couple of years have seen social media has succeeded to create strong movements changing the status quo forever. Greenpeace, Amnesty and others have succeeded in taking on big corporations and other organizations such as Avaaz have succeeded in creating a 18 million strong online community; the size of a country committed to people-powered action and democracy.</p><p>But one shouldn't be blinded by the digital and social possibilities. It also demands hard work &ndash; and it&rsquo;s increasingly harder to get your content to go viral without spending money, this has a lot to do with the fact that 60 hours of content is added to Youtube every minute.</p><p>At the Goodvertising Agency we believe in creating projects that first of all get causes and people to work together towards a common goal and in doing so turning them from target groups into collaborators. Our role is not to talk at people; it&rsquo;s to get people to talk to each other. We achieve this through a tool we call &ldquo;Shared Conversations&rdquo;, which basically helps identify topics of shared value, which is exactly the point of Goodvertising. When you&rsquo;re creating communication that&rsquo;s centred around making a difference in people&rsquo;s lives, the ideas are far sexier, and more exciting and engaging than simply shoveling messages down their throats.</p><p>It all comes down to the truth that nobody likes to be told that the life they&rsquo;re living is wrong or they could do more. There is no right answer for every assignment, but before you choose the oh-so-dull online petition or the typical oh-so-serious black-and-white viral with a voice-over that sounds like James Earl Jones, ask yourself how you can create an engaging conversation that makes a difference, for people, as well as a cause.</p><p><strong>Paul: What can you tell us about your new platform <a href=\"http://wheregoodgrows.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WhereGoodGrows</a>?</strong></p><p>Thomas: It&rsquo;s a project I&rsquo;m really passionate about. The idea behind WhereGoodGrows came about when I was doing the research for my book Goodvertising and I saw first-hand how all of these great campaigns were making a huge difference in peoples lives. One campaign that ran in the States &ldquo;Digital Death&rdquo; asked celebrities to pull the plug on their digital life until a donation goal of 1 million USD was reached to fight HIV. One ad showed Elijah Wood in a coffin with the headline: &ldquo;Elijah Wood is dead&rdquo;. It took only 5 days to raise the money. But instead of re-using a campaign like that in other countries around the world, it ends up in a book like mine gathering dust on a bookshelf. It&rsquo;s like asking a gold medallist Olympic athlete at the height of his career to quit athletics. Why don&rsquo;t we put these campaigns to further use?</p><p>WhereGoodGrows is more than just a name. It encapsulates our mission statement. We believe that if we all share communication solutions for good; we can accelerate innovation and ultimately do greater good for people, the planet and business. WhereGoodGrows is the world&rsquo;s first best-practice collaborative platform that not only shares communications solutions and aims to inspire communications professionals and brands around the world, but more importantly shares tangible results that really work for all stakeholders (people, the planet and business). Just think, if a campaign in Africa for HIV prevention really worked and saved thousands of lives, why not use that very same campaign in India? That&rsquo;s why we want to challenge the old concept of copyright and ask you to share your work with our Right to Recycle License, so others faced with the same challenges as you and your community can recreate your work with a local spin; only then can we truly do greater good.</p><p><strong>Paul: We ask each of our interviewees to browse our profiles of member causes and choose one to give a few words of advice or a creative idea to &ndash; which cause would you like to choose and what advice would you like to give them?</strong></p><p>Thomas: I absolutely love the thought behind Centre for Social Franchising &ndash; which is a kindred spirit of WhereGoodGrows. Its mission is to help the most successful social impact projects replicate. My advice: Go check it out &ndash; and support it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

  "content": "<h2>Ellipsis Unveils the First Brand Makeover of the Year</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Design agency <a href=\"http://www.ellipsis.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Ellipsis</a> is offering a different cause a complete brand makeover for each month of our Year of Great Marketing Karma. We caught up with the agency to see the results of their first intervention in support of <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/1610\" target=\"_blank\">Visits Unlimited</a> and were blown away by the agency&rsquo;s creativity. <br\/> <br\/><strong>The view from Ellipsis by Catherine Hampshire and Laura Mingozzi:</strong><br\/> <br\/><strong>The design request</strong><br\/>Visits Unlimited intends to become a nationally recognised organisation. They would like to be the first port of call for anyone wishing to go out for the day with a disabled child or young person, as well as becoming the most trusted training and mentoring organisation that venues will go to for advice, holistic service audits and great staff development. They hope that by accrediting venues on their quality mark scheme, family days out will be as fun and easy as possible. Above all, they want to give out a completely new message about disabled children: that these children are, above all else, just children, like any others. They want to get out, get down and dirty with all the rest, having fun and experiencing new things with their brothers, sisters and friends.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/vuweblogos.png\" alt=\"Pro bono brand makeover from Ellipsis\"\/><br\/> <br\/><strong>The solution</strong><br\/>From the very first conversation we had with Visits Unlimited, the founders' passion rubbed off on our design team. Key words from our chat were 'fun, memorable, genuine, commitment, helping hand'. Our design development focused on a family with a disabled child in a wheelchair, combined with a days out ticket and fun activity silhouettes. We designed a core ticket logo to be used on smaller items and stationery and five different day out silhouettes. This variety of options will help Visits Unlimited to present a professional side of their organisation to trainees and simultaneously appear fun and welcoming to families. The response to our ideas was extremely positive.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/vulogo.jpg\" alt=\"Visits Unlimited logo\"\/><br\/> <br\/><strong>The result</strong><br\/>It has been great working with such a passionate and enthusiastic team. Sarah and Katie from Visits Unlimited are so excited about our designs and have given fantastic feedback. We have learnt so much about their cause and hope that our branding and advice will ensure their dreams of being a nationally recognised organisation come true. <br\/> <br\/><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/vusmallbizcards.jpg\" alt=\"Visits Unlimited business cards\"\/><br\/><br\/><strong>Response from Visits Unlimited by Katie Clarke and Sarah Moore:</strong></p><p>When we first uploaded our request for help on the Pimp My Cause website, we didn't really know what to expect. To be honest, we thought our advert may have got lost amongst some of the more exciting-looking projects people had sent in, so we were pleasantly surprised to be contacted early in the new year by Anna with the opportunity to put ourselves forward for some pro-bono branding by Ellipsis.<br\/> <br\/> From the very start, the team at Ellipsis have been absolutely wonderful. They took the time to really understand our business ideas and our philosophy, in order to ensure that the finished logo and branding materials were a true reflection of everything we stand for and offer as a company.</p><p><br\/> When the initial designs arrived, we were overwhelmed with the creativity and imagination the team had employed. The discussion which followed really helped to narrow down our focus and arrive at a finished design that reflects our values and intentions and will 'grow with us', as our business develops.<br\/> <br\/> Visits Unlimited were very pleased to be able to visit Ellipsis at their offices in London part-way through the design process, where were welcomed like old friends. Laura and Catherine talked us through their ideas, and helped us to see how the branding comes together as a complete package. As an added bonus, the lovely Jon talked us through buying our domain name and setting up new email accounts.<br\/> <br\/> Visits Unlimited would like to take this opportunity to thank Anna from Pimp My Cause for spotting our little advert in the first place, and the whole team at Ellipsis, especially Laura and Catherine, for all their hard work on our behalf. We can't wait to start getting our wonderful branding out there into the world!</p><p><em>If you would like your cause to be considered for a brand makeover please <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/content/information/blog/ellipsis-announces-brand-you-initiative\" target=\"_blank\">read this post</a>.</em></p>"

Unlike mainstream healthcare, it focuses on music and the arts as a way of creating a community, support network and vehicle for client rehabilitation.</p><p>With several high profile charity music gigs in the pipeline for later in 2013, Upbeat are now looking for a programmer to get their impressive new site up and running and would be extremely grateful to hear from web developers in the Pimp My Cause community who might like to assist. Please contact lucia@upbeatmusic.org.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/upbeathomepage.jpg\" alt=\"Music charity gets a new web design from marketing volunteers\"\/></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The process of creating a new website began in August 2011 when Upbeat signed up to the Pimp My Cause website and became aware of an opportunity to directly approach a growing number of marketing professionals through this online platform. Upbeat duly contacted Ed Kemp about a redesign of their outdated website.</p><p>Ed kindly accepted the challenge, offered his skills in planning and wire framing, and recommended Rob Porter for the design aspect of the new site. A meeting between Ed, Rob and Upbeat representatives soon followed and the outline for Upbeat&rsquo;s new virtual home was established. The brief was to provide a high impact site that would appeal to supporters of the charity from a mental health and musical perspective. The site should be easy to use and easy to run (with Upbeat having limited time and resources).</p><p>Rob and Ed&rsquo;s background in designing bespoke online solutions for a range of clients helped to establish a clear vision for the homepage to be supplemented with the use of video and musical content generated by Upbeat&rsquo;s service users. Most importantly for a small charity, the homepage needs to have an instant appeal to potential donors visiting for the first time. It is hoped that the combination of Ed&rsquo;s layout, Rob&rsquo;s design, music, photos and advertised support of high profile patrons Coldplay will achieve this.</p><p>With these requirements in mind Ed established the wireframe for Upbeat&rsquo;s new homepage within a couple of months allowing Rob to get to work on the design. Despite personal and work circumstances changing for Upbeat members, Ed and Rob last year, all parties never lost site of the initial vision. Completion of sub level pages was fitted around busy schedules and Upbeat would like to thank Ed and Rob for abiding by their original commitment and producing an eye-catching and professional end product.</p><p>Upbeat would also like to re-iterate their gratitude to Pimp My Cause for facilitating such invaluable pro-bono work. I hope the Pimp My Cause readers like the new design as much as Upbeat do. We look forward to hearing from anyone who can help Upbeat programme the site and thereby reach out to a far wider audience.</p>"

  "content": "<h2>Building Career Experience Helps Burmese Refugees</h2><p>Taking the step to embed social media at the heart of a communications plan present a variety of strategic challenges. It requires an understanding of how best to engage with potential supporters in each setting and how to get your message across while creating conversations that others will want to participate in. And in the case of many of our causes it demands a thoughtful approach to addressing what can be extremely emotive issues.<br\/><br\/>In the fall of 2012 Valerie Lecomte was studying for a degree in marketing through the Chartered Institute of Marketing and as a part of her studies she needed to gain work experience. She connected with Stephanie Voytier, Communications and Resources Manager at <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/1472\" target=\"_blank\">Burma Assist</a>, through a French association and they made plans for Valerie to help Burma Assist with their social media marketing.<br\/><br\/>In order to take their work in Burma and India further Burma Assist needed to connect with more supporters online. They had plans to redesign their website and explore social media networking, but they needed volunteer support to make it happen. Having learnt about Pimp My Cause through the CIM Valerie signed up and encouraged Stephanie to sign up Burma Assist to connect with other marketing volunteers to help them achieve their goals.<br\/><br\/>Burma Assist is an international development organisation based in Edinburgh that provides professional and financial support to Burmese community-led projects.</p><p><img title=\"Burmese refugee that received skills training from Burma Assist\" src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/kamchanged_1.jpg\" alt=\"Burma Assist beneficiary\"\/><br\/><span>The image above shows Kamthang, a beneficiary of Burma Assist, &nbsp;who was 15 years old when she joined the Dorcas Tailoring Training Centre in Delhi, a community-led project supported by Burma Assist.

She is now a successful tailor in her village and doing very well.</span><br\/><br\/><span>Kamthang, like many other Burmese fled fear and poverty in Burma. And over 100,000 are struggling to survive in India. They face harsh living conditions but until recently they had hope that they would be resettled in a third country to start a new life. With the recent changes in Burma resettlements have become rare. In Burma, poverty is still a reality and democracy has a long way to go. So more than ever skills and self-confidence are crucial for them to survive in India or in Burma.</span></p><p><img title=\"Marketing volunteer provides pro bono social media strategy support\" src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/burma.jpeg\" alt=\"Burma Assist Facebook page\"\/></p><p>Valerie worked for Burma Assist for about three months as a Social Media and Marketing Volunteer. She developed Social Media accounts which were nearly non-existent before her arrival. She designed the Facebook page and participated in the development of the communication strategy. The aim of the strategy was to develop the charity network and raise the awareness of their work. \"As a result of Valerie's work we are now getting more and more comments on our Facebook page.

Recent graphic design graduate <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/professionals/more_information/1475\" target=\"_blank\">Steven Harding</a> responded to their ad and is now using his impressive skills to redesign the Burma Assist website and at the same time is building his professional portfolio.

She was eager to thank John for his support, \"John was simply amazing. Nothing was too much trouble, although I do think that I tried his patience, particularly when we had to change the music track right after everything was done. And he still did this absolutely charmingly. He is one of the easiest people to work with &ndash; he basically sourced the venue, did the shooting, did the editing and worked miracles &ndash; on nothing.

It will help support the Occupational Therapy programme which is a mix of horticulture, beekeeping (we hope); and various other practical courses to enable the veterans to gain a skill &ndash; this is a long-term project which enables veterans to dip in and out depending on how they are best able to cope. Many of our veterans have mental health issues and our aim is to support them as best we are able to help them get better and to be able to function back within the community. This is why the support of our local communities is so vital to what we do. It will also assist with funding our support groups, what we want to do in &lsquo;outreach&rsquo; &ndash; there is so much we need and we have so little to do it with.</p><p><strong>Q: Can you give specific examples of groups that will be participating in the fundraiser?</strong></p><p>A: That is what is so great about the idea, it can be dance groups (there is one group planning to participate down in Cornwall); schools, fitness classes &ndash; I think that Gill has got them training up in Scarborough &ndash; tea dances, jive, samba, anything &ndash; literally anything. The more people who participate the better &ndash; we want lots of uploaded videos on our Facebook page from all over the world!! I love the way that using something like Dance which is so uplifting and as Matt Flint said so &lsquo;good for the soul&rsquo; is such a balance to something as sad as homelessness, depression and feeling rejected.</p><p><strong>Q: Can you give us suggestions of fun ways to participate in Dance Day UK?</strong></p><p>A: I think what would be the greatest of fun would be to get a group together on Saturday and have a massive street party with families doing all sorts of dance. It is such a great way to get together....And to be honest we are so lucky in this country &ndash; our armed forces enable us to do this by protecting us in all sorts of different ways, and places. We sometimes forget that.</p>"

This was recognised and liked, so the essence of this original design was retained in the design process.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/the_parent_house.jpg\" alt=\"The Parent House logo designed by Ellipsis\"\/></p><p><em>New logo for The Parent House</em></p><p><strong>The solution</strong><br\/>From the outset it was apparent that the services offered by The Parent House were varied but all sought to create opportunities for the parents. Our initial design development focused on creating a strapline which conveyed this message. Working with the house icon, we designed a selection of logos that used a friendly hand-drawn style alongside the text. The simpler marks were preferred, especially the house with an open door and initials.<br\/><br\/><strong>The result</strong><br\/>After the ideas were shown to the parents and trustees, the hand drawn house logo was approved. Combining the icon with the name and strapline 'opening doors for you' created a new, refreshed and modern identity for The Parent House. A bright, welcoming cyan blue was chosen as the colour accent.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/tph_business_cards.jpg\" alt=\"Business cards created by marketing volunteers at Ellipsis Design Agency\"\/></p><p><em>New business cards for The Parent House</em><br\/><br\/><strong>Response from The Parent House by Gina Camputaro:</strong><br\/><br\/>The Parent House is a charity based in Islington, which aims to improve the aspirations and lives of parents and carers who are at risk of exclusion and isolation. We have been supporting parents and carers since 2000. We provide one to one support, bespoke training, mentoring and an ofsted registered cr&egrave;che. We have been looking at our marketing and how we communicate our cause to both our clients and funders. Being a small charity, we tend to be busy working directly with parents and never have the time or skills to focus on this. We applied to Pimp My Cause and were quickly contacted and offered support.<br\/><br\/>I met with Catherine and Laura, who showed an interest in our project. I wasn't sure what to expect, but they were very clear about what they could offer and the timescales within which they would work. I was impressed with their professionalism and how clearly they followed the plan that they had laid out. They initially proposed several alternative creative directions and we gave feedback. They paid real attention to our feedback and were passionate about creating something that we would like.<br\/><br\/>The process was efficient and the result is a new brand look. We are really impressed with Ellipsis. Having matching letterheads, business cards etc, is all very new to us. We are looking forward to launching it and we are very happy with the result.</p>"

It is to enable people to make better choices by designing and framing choices in accordance with human nature. The value this can offer to social marketing programmes and charities is potentially limitless. It was always our intention that #ogilvychange should devote part of its time to charitable causes and to small businesses. There were two reasons for this. One is wholly altruistic - the use of behavioural economics is a relatively quick and inexpensive way to make a difference to such organisations where it matters most. And there is, of course, an ulterior motive, in that lessons learned from these activities can be deployed elsewhere in our commercial work&rdquo;.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>In Rory&rsquo;s Tedx talk in Athens he talks about the importance of perception over reality and the value of psychology over traditional economics in finding a successful outcome to any problem.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><iframe src=\"http://embed.ted.com/talks/rory_sutherland_perspective_is_everything.html\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" ></iframe></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>According to Jez Groom, head of #ogilvychange, &ldquo;We created #ogilvychange to increase the health, wealth and wellbeing of people across the world and we can think of no better partnership, than with Pimp My Cause to further this ambition. #ogilvychange combines the gravitas of academia with the real world communication expertise to create little behavioural ideas that can have a demonstrable effect and can really help some of these very worthwhile causes.&rdquo;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Three cause members who are actively seeking solutions to behaviour change problems will be selected per year in an ongoing collaboration that will support each chosen cause with behavioural advice and creative solutions to the challenges they face. The process will create a new body of emerging knowledge that will be shared across the Pimp My Cause platform and across Ogilvy's audiences for the broader benefit of society. There are also plans to develop fresh ways to activate Ogilvy's growing broader behaviour change community inside and outside the Group to harness its talent for good.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Paul Skinner, founder of Pimp My Cause said: \"Behavioural economics represents a great opportunity for small charities and social enterprises seeking to make a big difference. Its insights often cost nothing to apply and can make a disproportionate contribution to the kinds of changes that voluntary sector organisations are trying to achieve. This is also a great example of leadership from Ogilvy in showing that marketers are among the best placed professionals to creatively apply its principles and that agencies can make a real difference even away from their traditional high media spend environment.\"</div><div>&nbsp;</div>"

After posting our needs we had a number of enquiries and we gained support from <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/professionals/more_information/155\" target=\"_blank\">Jermaine Ranger</a>. He came to meet us to discuss our needs in depth and then drafted a marketing strategy for us which acted as a starting point for us to develop our own initiatives.

(Our next project is a video about our campaign.)<br\/> <br\/>With our new direction a new name was called for and once we had several good suggestions a vote among staff, trustees and volunteers produced our new name, Advice4Renters. <br\/> <br\/>Our next move was to find someone to build us a new website. We had confidence in <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/professionals/more_information/1198\" target=\"_blank\">Bek Cruddace</a> from the start. She sent us a detailed questionnaire so that she could fully understand not only what we wanted to put on the site, but our style and what makes us tick.

He has vast commercial experience using social networking for marketing and he offered to help to raise our profile. Since Bruce came on board we have been going from strength to strength. At the moment Bruce is actually doing the promotion directly, but in due course he will start coaching us so that we can keep up the momentum that he is creating.<br\/> <br\/>What a transformation, and all triggered by the wonderful Pimp My Cause website. <br\/> <br\/>We still have a lot to learn but we feel that in the last few months we have fast forwarded the organisation by decades.

They aim to lift the spirit, engage the mind and stimulate the imagination through the presentation of all forms of storytelling to a wide audience of all ages and backgrounds.</p><p>Ellipsis was approached to help with the creation of a clear and recognisable new set of branding materials, which would give Settle Stories communications a consistent and professional look, while still maintaining a sense of fun and subtly referencing what they do.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/settle_stories_logo.jpg\" alt=\"Logo options from the Brand-You initiative\"\/></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The solution</strong></p><p>The logo design has two separable elements &ndash; the Settle Stories name is modern, bold and simple, easily read and reproduced. This is then enclosed between two quotation marks, each with a dot which turns the mark into a face profile with an eye and mouth. These then give the appearance of speaking the words &lsquo;Settle Stories&rsquo;, emphasising the that Settle Stories is all about the spoken word. The second element of the logo is an icon made up of the two quotation marks. It can be pulled out and used on its own where space is limited or as a symbol for the brand. When the two quotation marks come together, the face then appears to be head on, with two eyes and a welcoming smile. The main logo colour is green to give a bright and friendly feel and also reflect the Yorkshire Dales landscape where Settle is based. A secondary blue colour was then added to represent the W.R. Mitchell Archive and a monotone version where only black and white printing is available.</p><p>Once the logo had been designed the branding was rolled out across all materials, including Word templates, compliments slips, business cards, email signatures and web banners, thus creating a consistent, clean and recognisable look and feel.</p><p>Finally, we produced a set of brand guidelines that helped to give clear instruction on how to use elements within all communications and merchandise.</p><p>Working with Sita at Settle Stories was a pleasure from start to finish. We were initially impressed by the variety and quantity of activities that Settle Stories arrange, and were inspired by Sita&rsquo;s passion for everything they do. The original brief was clear and the response to designs was always very positive and precise, helping us to find a natural solution quickly and efficiently that everyone was very happy with.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/settle_stories_biz_card.jpg\" alt=\"Business cards created for Settle Stories by a design volunteer\"\/></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Response from Settle Stories by Sita Brand:</strong></p><p>Settle Stories is an organisation whose activities centre on the oral tradition of storytelling. Ellipsis really took the time to understand the nature of what we do; they produced a clear brand identity that ties the multiple strands of our work together and offers a strong indication of the importance of speech within our work. This new branding will allow us to more easily communicate our identity, whether we&rsquo;re delivering our Storytelling Festival, promoting the W. R. Mitchell oral history archive, or communicating the power of storytelling to others.</p><p>We can&rsquo;t thank Ellipsis enough for their time, dedication and being great to work with.</p>"

I needed to do my part to build a debate to prevent this from happening to someone else.&rdquo;<br\/><br\/><iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/74311005\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe><br\/><em>Clips from Full Circle&rsquo;s #KeepingItReal Conference in Cardiff, filmed by Laura.</em><br\/><br\/>&ldquo;This need is what took me all the way to Wales to the #KeepingItReal Conference and Campaign. In the process of filming the conference I saw Natasha Devon&rsquo;s self-esteem class. I loved it; it was what I wanted to say already packaged for teenagers.&rdquo; Once Laura met Natasha she knew she had the subject for her documentary. Natasha agreed to be filmed and <em>Where I Want to Go</em> was created. The film will be submitted to film festivals later this year and will be available to the public after submission.<br\/><br\/>Nikki Giant, Managing Director of Full Circle, says &ldquo;Laura has kindly allowed us to distribute <em>Where I Want to Go</em> to the schools who attended our conference last year and I think it will be a great resource for them. I am planning to put some lesson plans together to go with the film for use in the classroom.&rdquo;<br\/><br\/>&ldquo;We are still focusing on the #KeepingItReal Campaign and will use the campaign themes this year for National Anti-Bullying Week. We are also planning to do a spin-off campaign around the idea of &lsquo;Keeping It Respectful&rsquo;.\"</p>"

She has a practical background in marketing and advertising, but wanted live experience to compliment the new theoretical knowledge she had gained through her recently completed Chartered Institute of Marketing diploma.</p><p>While on a career break for maternity leave she found Pimp My Cause and approached Resources for Autism to offer her support with their social media marketing strategy.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/playworkers2.jpg\" alt=\"Staff and volunteers of Resouces for Autism\"\/></p><p><em>Some of the staff and volunteers at Resources for Autism.</em></p><p>Resources for Autism is a charity providing practical services for children and adults with autism and support for their families in Greater London and the West Midlands.

The dynamic, regular posts which Kavita helped them design have already taken their Facebook &ldquo;likes&rdquo; from 39 to over 600 without the need for any media spend and they are also now active on Twitter and Youtube and making better use of their website to connect with their online audience.</p><p>Liza is grateful for the support they have had, &ldquo;Kavita has been invaluable to us. She has been generous in sharing her skills and expertise and understanding of our limited time and limited knowledge. She has been enthusiastic about what we do and a pleasure to work with.&rdquo;</p><p>Kavita is continuing to support their activity and is currently helping them plan a micro-site for crowd funding to engage with new funding sources and help convert some of their online support into donations.</p><p>&ldquo;I was directed to Pimp My Cause at a time when I had been out of the work place for a while and due to personal circumstances could not enter into full-time employment,&rdquo; Kavita shared. &ldquo;Having always wanted to volunteer with charities, I was delighted to have an opportunity to develop and manage online marketing projects for Resources For Autism and Drama Workshouse who were without budgets and a bit unclear of how to move forward in the world of social media and digital.&rdquo;</p><p>Stay tuned for a post about Kavita&rsquo;s work with Drama Workhouse coming soon.</p>"

The charity runs sociable regular projects that appeal to all abilities and are essentially fun! The new logo needed to represent the stringed instrument, movement and essence of Open Strings. It also had to appeal primarily to older adults, but also to potential funders and sponsors.

The response from Bela Emerson, the charity's founder, was extremely positive.

The unique perspective of senior marketers can be hugely valuable to charities and social enterprises. An interesting example of this is the work that <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/professionals/more_information/1957\" target=\"_blank\">Gareth Simpson</a>, global operations director at Leo Burnett, has been doing with <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/1939\" target=\"_blank\">St John International</a>.</p><p>Gareth met Pimp My Cause at The Marketing Society&rsquo;s Summer Party on a Knightsbridge rooftop garden where The Marketing Society announced their partnership with Pimp My Cause and encouraged all of their members to work with our causes.</p><p>Gareth expressed his interest in supporting a cause with international expansion and was introduced by our chief match maker to Louisa Boyle, head of communications and fundraising for the Order of St John International Development Office in London.</p><p>Over the past few months Gareth has been supporting them with their rebranding work. He was also on hand to help Louisa with the incredible task of preparing for the charity&rsquo;s visit from Desmond Tutu. The celebrated social rights activist visited their office a couple of weeks ago to discuss their international development work. He is a trustee of the Order of St John and a supporter of their new Mother and Child programme, which ensures that St John volunteers are there to help save hundreds of lives in Africa at the crucial time of child birth.<strong></strong></p><p>Archbishop Tutu gave an interview about St John International&rsquo;s work and Gareth and Louisa worked together to prepare the interview script and make the most from his visit.</p><p>Desmond Tutu&rsquo;s very charming answers to their questions make for must see Youtube viewing.</p><p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/v8J6SJTc3VM\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Above is a heartwarming clip from the interview with Desmond Tutu. You can view all of the video clips from Desmond Tutu&rsquo;s visit on the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9pH21-eCtmVHQM5qhuhRSw\" target=\"_blank\">St John International Youtube channel</a>.</em></p><p>The task of rebranding St John&rsquo;s International Development office provided Louisa with an intriguing challenge. While their parent brand St John is extremely well known for their first aid and ambulance work, the Development office was a new team with their own mission. Louisa&rsquo;s team needed to differentiate their work from the work being done by St John in the UK and create a brand that paid tribute to their history while shining light on their new humanitarian programmes overseas.</p><p>&ldquo;Gareth has worked with us to take the former &lsquo;Order of St John&rsquo; into a new brand era to allow us to position our international work and specifically our international development work more clearly and to allow people to understand far more clearly what we do; how to donate and what our areas of work are,&rdquo; shared Louisa.</p><p>Gareth has supported Louisa&rsquo;s team throughout their rebranding process, even presenting their new brand choice to the charity&rsquo;s global board himself. Gareth shared the importance of the new brand positioning and the thinking and philosophy behind it and his presentation was very well received.</p><p>Louisa explained, &ldquo;Gareth took a project that for everyone seemed quite daunting and made it look easy!&rdquo;</p><p>She continued, &ldquo;We are moving forward progressively with our new brand &ndash; now calling ourselves &lsquo;St John International&rsquo; which we feel far more accurately describes the fact that we are a global health care charity. Many people know the St John brand and know that we do first aid and ambulance provision, so it makes sense that we keep St John and add in International to show that we do this work throughout the world.&rdquo;</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/sji_twitter.jpg\" alt=\"New branding for St John International created by marketing volunteer\"\/></p><p>&ldquo;We are working towards launching our new brand early next year as we also launch our Mother and Child programme, but in the meantime we are developing our new interactive website,&rdquo; Louisa commented. &ldquo;However, we have been able in the last few weeks to launch our new social media presence on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/stjohninternat\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StJohnInternat\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9pH21-eCtmVHQM5qhuhRSw\" target=\"_blank\">Youtube</a> and <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/company/st-john-international\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a> with our new St John International Identity and are looking for lots of new followers and connections on these sites.&rdquo;</p>"

We didn&rsquo;t have any budget for design and marketing expertise, so I looked for pro bono support.&rdquo;</p><p>Mary found Pimp My Cause through a Google search and contacted <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/professionals/more_information/1986\" target=\"_blank\">Simon Guest</a> because his background and skills gave her confidence that his support would be a big boost for their project.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/springboard4.jpg\" alt=\"Impact statement created by pro bono marketers\"\/></p><p>Once Simon got involved Mary knew that the project of creating their impact statement would be a success. Mary said, &ldquo;Simon was extremely helpful in taking me through what we were trying to achieve. He created a copy brief to share with others and used his network to source support for editing (Rick) and design (Martin). Springboard drafted the content which was edited and then the design was created using our photos. Simon coordinated the work and brought the whole project together.&rdquo;</p><p>Mary continued, &ldquo;Simon also helped us develop a new, very clear brand proposition for the organisation which we are now using in all our communications.&rdquo;</p><p>This brand proposition includes a clear definition of Springboard&rsquo;s mission which further helps to frame the charity&rsquo;s identity: &ldquo;Springboard for Children believes every child has the right to a fair chance of future success. Springboard is a charity providing one-to-one support to improve reading and writing for children who are in danger of being left behind in the education system. We only work one-to-one with children and we always work in partnership with schools.&rdquo;</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/springboard1.jpg\" alt=\"Design and editing done by marketing volunteers\"\/></p><p>Reading the impact statement created by the Springboard team with the help of Simon, Rick and Martin it is easy to appreciate all of the hard work that has gone into this project. The impact statement is clear, easy to read and understand, beautifully designed and very inspiring. Simple design, bright colours and engaging photos are used to draw attention to important information and inspiring case studies. It is a good mix of facts and figures and also shares a few of the individual stories of children&rsquo;s progress as a result of the Springboard for Children tutoring programmes.</p><p>Since the impact statement was completed Simon has continued to support Springboard for Children as they build their brand and look to gain more external support.</p><p>In April/ May 2014 Springboard for Children hopes to have their five year strategy in place and would love to have additional support in building their marketing plan and translating their goals into an external engagement strategy.

Their mission is to help prevent social exclusion and loneliness by giving people the tools to better prepare for handling the loss of a loved one, to talk about death and the issues it raises in a more informed way and to help all of us know how to support our friends, colleagues and neighbours who are grieving.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/deeplake.jpg\" alt=\"#ogilvychange give behaviour change support to CEDAR CIC\"\/></p><p>People often don&rsquo;t know how to deal with the difficult topic of death or how best to support people who have been affected by bereavement and therefore avoid interacting with people who have lost someone close to them. The combination of grief and the social isolation it can lead to, can bring very serious secondary problems such as alcoholism or drug abuse, clinical depression, escalating violence, self-harm, increased absenteeism and many other knock-on effects of un-alleviated suffering.</p><p>CEDAR offers death education courses to help people become better equipped for dealing with death and bereavement. Their courses make a positive difference to people&rsquo;s lives, but an obstacle that CEDAR faces is that many people avoid taking them in the first place simply because they find the topic off-putting and would rather avoid it.</p><p>#ogilvychange set out to help CEDAR further achieve their mission by finding a way to nudge the public into confronting this challenging subject. They said this was one of the most emotional briefs they had ever taken on, and they came up with the brilliant solution of reframing death education as &ldquo;Good Grief&rdquo;. As a brand agenda for the cause, &ldquo;Good Grief&rdquo; sends a positive message; engages people in better understanding and supporting the grieving process; and takes away the potentially intimidating connotations of formal education.</p><p>CEDAR is already making great progress with developing their new Good Grief programmes and the work done by #ogilvychange has enabled CEDAR to access pro bono support from a web developer, who is currently building their new website, and from a university art department, which will help them create new designs for their branding and brochures in line with Ogilvy&rsquo;s advice.</p><p>#ogilvychange also proposed a suite of initiatives to help CEDAR drive the Good Grief agenda forwards. For example in today&rsquo;s society there is no longer a social custom, such as the mourning dress of the Victorian era, to indicate that someone is grieving or to give an outward expression to their inner feelings. The #ogilvychange team developed the idea for a visible marker which could be worn to indicate that someone is grieving and that they are open to support during that difficult time.</p><p>If you would like to help CEDAR make the most out of the behaviour change solutions developed by #ogilvychange, you can get in touch with us to offer them your support by emailing <a href=\"mailto:anna@pimpmycause.org\">anna@pimpmycause.org</a>. They are currently looking for further help developing their communications strategy and in making the most out of the new opportunities for partnership and collaboration that the Good Grief agenda is already opening up for them.</p><p><strong>Would you like #ogilvychange to help your cause?</strong></p><p>If you would like your cause to be selected to be supported through our partnership with #ogilvychange please get in touch with us and let us know what behaviour you seek to change.</p><p>#ogilvychange takes a behavioural science approach that combines the gravitas of leading research in cognitive psychology and behavioural economics with the communication expertise of the Ogilvy group.</p><p>Many of the factors that affect our decision making are subconscious and hence we are not aware that they are driving our behaviour. #ogilvychange exists to identify the subconscious triggers and barriers to our behaviour according to the leading academic research.</p><p>This is an incredible opportunity to harness world leading expertise to help you achieve more for your beneficiaries.</p>"

  "content": "<h2 align=\"center\">#ogilvychange Applies Behavioural Insights to Save Sumatran Orangutans</h2><p>As many of you know, Rory Sutherland is leading the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ogilvychange.com/\" target=\"_blank\">#ogilvychange</a>&nbsp;team in supporting three of our member causes per year with their behavior change advisory service. The <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/109\" target=\"_blank\">Sumatran Orangutan Society (SOS)</a> was the second cause to gain support through this partnership. They were selected because they posed an intriguing behavioural challenge, which they referred to as &ldquo;a cuddle can kill&rdquo;.</p><p><strong>The Problem</strong></p><p>Orangutans are adorable creatures, but could this be their downfall? When someone has flown half way around the world to visit them in their natural habitat, they can&rsquo;t help but feel a desire to get up close and personal. The issue with human-orangutan interactions is that orangutans share 96.4% of our DNA, which is enough to catch a cold from us but not enough to fight it off.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/cute_orangutans.jpg\" alt=\"Wild orangutans in Sumatra\"\/></p><p>This is a major problem because orangutans are now critically endangered. They are the first great ape to face extinction, with only 6,600 orangutans left in the wild in Sumatra. The mismanaged tourism practices in the Gunung Leuser National Park have led to an infant mortality rate of 55% - more than five times higher than other wild orangutan populations.</p><p>The orangutan is one of the biggest drawing points attracting tourists to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. And though it is strictly forbidden to touch, feed, or disturb the orangutans at the Gunung Leuser National Park, such practices still occur, which is why changing tourists&rsquo; behaviour is now so vitally important.</p><p><strong>The Solution</strong></p><p>The #ogilvychange team suggested that in order for tourism to play a role in protecting orangutans and preserving their environment, the first step is to change tourists&rsquo; expectations before they reach Sumatra. #ogilvychange developed the concept for a participatory campaign under the banner 'Don&rsquo;t be an idiot abroad', which offers people advice and guidance so they understand the local customs of Indonesia and the importance of protecting orangutans before they visit.</p><p>The campaign concept includes approaching travelers through Twitter, Google and Foursquare, sharing a video presentation on the plane ride to Indonesia and giving them more information once they arrive in Sumatra, as well as reinforcing the same guidelines at their arrival to Gunung Leuser National Park.</p><p>The 'Don&rsquo;t be an idiot abroad' campaign&nbsp;has great potential for celebrity engagement as well and coincidentally Ricky Gervais, co-creator of An Idiot Abroad, is already a fan and active supporter of the Sumatran Orangutan Society.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/rickysos.jpg\" alt=\"#ogilvychange supports SOS with pro bono behaviour change service\"\/></p><p>SOS is currently reworking their orangutan etiquette guide according to the principles of behavioural economics recommended by #ogilvychange to work with people&rsquo;s subconscious to help them make better choices when visiting orangutans. And they are also implementing the many other ways to change behaviour suggested by #ogilvychange, including changing the communications that tourists see as they explore the National Park to have the biggest impact on tourist behaviour and ways to work with their tour guides to change the culture around allowing orangutan-human interactions.</p><p>Another focus of SOS&rsquo;s work is a Spotlight on Sumatra exhibition, which will be held in May at London&rsquo;s South Bank. It is a month-long open air photography exhibition celebrating the biodiversity of this little-known island, the only place in the world where orangutans, tigers, elephants and rhinos all roam under the same forest canopy. The exhibition will also raise awareness of the threats facing Sumatra's rainforests and wildlife, and draw attention to the conservation projects working on the frontline to protect them.</p><p>If you would like to help SOS build on the work started by #ogilvychange or help them prepare for the Spotlight on Sumatra exhibition by donating your marketing or social media marketing expertise, please email anna@pimpmycause.org.</p><p><strong>Would you like #ogilvychange to help your cause?</strong></p><p>If you would like your cause to be selected to be supported through our partnership with #ogilvychange please get in touch with us and let us know what behaviour you seek to change.</p><p>#ogilvychange takes a behavioural science approach that combines the gravitas of leading research in cognitive psychology and behavioural economics with the communication expertise of the Ogilvy group.</p><p>Many of the factors that affect our decision making are subconscious and hence we are not aware that they are driving our behaviour. #ogilvychange exists to identify the subconscious triggers and barriers to our behaviour according to the leading academic research.</p><p>This is an incredible opportunity to harness world leading expertise to help you achieve more for your beneficiaries.<br\/> </p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

  "content": "<h2>An Inspiring Design Makeover for SportInspired</h2><p>The community sports social enterprise <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/1343\" target=\"_blank\">SportInspired</a> has received a brand makeover from the <a href=\"http://www.ellipsis.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">design agency Ellipsis</a> as part of our on-going <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/content/information/blog/ellipsis-announces-brand-you-initiative/18\" target=\"_blank\">Brand-You collaboration</a>. We've caught up with Ellipsis and SportInspired to learn about the results of their work together.</p><p><strong>The view from Ellipsis by Catherine Hampshire and Tonie Lam:</strong></p><p><strong>The design request</strong></p><p>SportInspired are a charitable organisation that aims to build confidence and drive up activity levels within young people through the power of sport. They work in partnership with businesses, such as Sky and Deloitte to deliver community and staff development goals and help local authorities to tackle inactivity and obesity.</p><p>SportInspired came to Ellipsis with a need to re-design their existing identity. The brief was to design an identity that represented their five main stakeholders, reflected their SportInspired passion and communicated their personality coherently.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/sportinspired_logo.jpg\" alt=\"Logo created by design volunteers\"\/></p><p><strong>The solution</strong></p><p>In order to get a better understanding of the organisation and the work that SportInspired do, we invited their team up to our studio for an informal meeting and were immediately impressed by their passion and enthusiasm. They explained that the emphasis should be on the &lsquo;inspired&rsquo; element of their name, rather than &lsquo;sport&rsquo; and that they wanted a design to appeal to everyone, but in particular to their corporate partners.</p><p>The final identity captures the &lsquo;coming together&rsquo; of communities through the different coloured arrows forming a circle. Each colour corresponds to one of the five stakeholder groups, providing an easy way to distinguish between them. The use of bright colours and dynamic shapes simultaneously represents the structure of the organisation and communicates a fun and welcoming message. In addition to the main identity, five stakeholder logos and a SportInspired Games mark were designed for more specific usage. To help tell the story behind SportInspired&rsquo;s work in both a functional and playful way a &lsquo;community&rsquo; illustration was also designed to accompany the logo. The response to our ideas was well received and we have applied the final designs to stationery and presentation templates.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/sportinspired_stakeholders.jpg\" alt=\"Design work created pro bono\"\/></p><p><strong>The result</strong></p><p>SportInspired have shown extreme passion in their work, making this BrandYou project a pleasure to complete. We have learnt a great deal about their cause and wish them the very best in their future endeavours, especially now that they have a brand identity that they are proud of and can use with confidence.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/sportinspired_stationery.jpg\" alt=\"Branding work by Ellipsis design agency\"\/></p><p><strong>Response from Sport Inspired by Anna Springbett:</strong></p><p>As a growing social enterprise, we&rsquo;ve always prided ourselves on delivering exceptional programmes within the community. However, the standard of our branding and communications wasn&rsquo;t keeping up and we reached a stage where we realised this was important to the people we worked with and hope to work with. We don&rsquo;t have the skills and resources internally to get this done, so working with Ellipsis has made a huge difference to us. We now have a great logo and templates that show us as the professional organisation we&rsquo;ve always known we are! It&rsquo;s taking us to a very exciting next stage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

This Upbeat &ndash; Eazl collaboration has spawned the Art in a Box fundraiser, which has subsequently attracted fourteen high profile artists from the worlds of music, entertainment and sport to paint canvases in support of Upbeat.</p><p>The artwork, including pieces from Joanna Lumley, Coldplay and Sir Ian Botham, is due to be exhibited in London's Store Street Gallery from 19 - 23rd May before being auctioned at a gala fundraising evening on Friday 23rd May. Exciting times indeed for Upbeat!</p><p>Several years ago, through Pimp My Cause Upbeat also received some pro bono strategic marketing advice from John Grant where John suggested that Upbeat should look to forge links with high profile musicians and entertainers in the wake of reduced local authority funding. We think the Art in a Box project is a step towards this vision.</p><p>However, getting the project off the ground has relied heavily upon the impact, functionality and design of the new website, which initially helped to attract celebrity artists and a host of companies who have offered their services, products and venues in order to bring the Art In A Box fundraiser to life. The website also provides the ideal viewing platform for the <a href=\"http://www.upbeatmusic.org/art-box/\" target=\"_blank\">Art In A Box gallery</a> page through which site visitors can bid for the artwork.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/artinabox.jpg\" alt=\"Art in a box celebrity fundraiser\"\/></p><p>In addition to this fundraising campaign, Upbeat has managed to secure funding for its core services in spring/ summer 2014 (i.e. running music workshops for those recovering from mental health issues) and has opened discussions with a large corporate over forming a longer-term partnership.</p><p>Operating within the current competitive environment for charity fundraising, Upbeat doubts whether it would have been possible to attract this level of support without its new online home. Everyone involved with Upbeat remains grateful to those who helped put this vital first building block in place. <br\/> <br\/> Despite recent successes Upbeat recognises that more work is required to secure the organisation&rsquo;s long-term future. With this in mind they are once again appealing to the kind-hearted Pimp My Cause professionals for help with social media and online marketing. Upbeat would love to hear from any marketing professionals with experience in these areas who might relish the challenge of reaching out to new supporters and helping this music and performing arts charity capitalise on their recent &lsquo;brush with fame&rsquo;.</p><p>Thanks in advance to the Pimp My Cause Community.</p><p>Please email <a href=\"mailto:anna@pimpmycause.org\">anna@pimpmycause.org</a> if you are interested in supporting Upbeat with your marketing talent.</p>"

The kids not only learn but are entertained; we know that kids, just like the adults need opportunities for quality recreation that can help them to build positive lives. We also know there is a void in this city when it comes to entertainment for kids, most of the venues, like bowling lanes, movie theaters, arcades, and clubs have closed down and the ones that are open are for profit, and the kids can&rsquo;t afford to attend.&rdquo;</p><p>If you would like to support the work of Club Kids at this time of growth and ambition by helping to develop their media and corporate engagement strategies please send us an email.</p><p>And look out for more design and web development projects from Sotiria and Theo coming soon.&nbsp;</p>"

  "content": "<h2>Building the NGO of the Future</h2><p>Paul Skinner, the founder of Pimp My Cause, participated in a public debate on the Future of the NGO as part of the Start Network&rsquo;s first annual conference earlier this month. Below is the video of his introductory remarks.&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/I8vuQOn5bMY\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe></p><p><em>For more information about the event, below is an excerpt from a great article by Elizabeth Blunt originally published on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.irinnews.org/report/100221/ngos-and-the-shock-of-the-new\" target=\"_blank\">IRIN on June 16th, 2014</a> about the Start Network and their disruptive work in the NGO sector, with insights from Paul.</em></p><p>The big international aid agencies have been hugely successful. Organizations that were once small civil society operations - groups of friends with a passion to make the world a better place - now have thousands of staff members, multi-story headquarters buildings and multi-million dollar budgets. But insiders fret that they have become too big and have lost the flexibility and responsiveness they once had.</p><p>They also worry about the future, and whether big international agencies are still the best way of doing things. It's hard to imagine a world without Oxfam or Save the Children, but 20 years ago it would have been hard to imagine a world without Kodak film and cameras, or multi-volume editions of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Now both have gone, swept away by technological change they were slow to see coming.</p><p>In Britain a lot of soul-searching is taking place inside what is known as the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.start-network.org/\" target=\"_blank\">START Network</a>&nbsp;(once called the Consortium of British Humanitarian Agencies), which brings together 19 major NGOs and their worldwide partner organizations. The Network's Director, Sean Lowrie, thinks the way the sector works is cumbersome and old fashioned. \"NGOs are stuck in a Victorian model, which requires people to suffer and die to get on the front page of newspapers, and the newspapers trigger public donations and that triggers political will. It's a reactive model,\" he says.</p><p>It's also very slow. The START Network is explicitly looking for a new and better way of working, and has made a beginning with the START fund, a pot of money provided by the UK's Department for International Development (DFID) and Irish Aid, which can be mobilized immediately in a crisis and channelled to whichever organization, international or local, is best placed to use it. The key is that the money is already there - it doesn't have to wait for a crisis to get on the television news. Smaller emergencies or slow-onset crises may never give rise to that kind of money-generating publicity.</p><p>Olivia Maehler, START's business manager, said they aim to consider proposals and release funds within 72 hours of receiving an alert. \"We could get an alert on a Tuesday and the funding could be going out by Friday morning,\" she told IRIN.</p><p>The fund is still in its 'design and build' stage, but has already been able to respond to the violence in Rakhine State, Myanmar, and to one of the sudden spikes in conflict and displacement in South Sudan. Until now the meetings to allocate funds have taken place in London. \"We are hoping that for future project selection we will be able to do the decision-making in the field, at the local level,\" Maehler says.</p><p>But the tools that make this kind of devolved, collaborative way of working possible also threaten to disrupt the traditional roles of the big NGOs and perhaps bypass them altogether. At a public debate in London, linked to START's first annual conference, speakers presented the kind of innovations that have the power to shake up humanitarian action.</p><p>Paul Skinner, whose organization, 'Pimp My Cause', matches marketing volunteers with charities and social enterprises that need their skills, spoke of the need to harness people's underlying participatory spirit, and \"make a humanitarian of everyone\".</p><p>\"Whereas the NGO of the past may have been something you chose to support, maybe in quite passive ways, the NGO of the future is likely to be something you will turn to because they can help you achieve something worthwhile yourself,\" he said.</p><p>You can read the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.irinnews.org/report/100221/ngos-and-the-shock-of-the-new\" target=\"_blank\">full article here</a>.</p>"

Blue Ventures has done an excellent job of education around these issues, but there is a gap between knowledge and actual behaviour, which is why they needed #ogilvychange&rsquo;s expertise in creatively applying the principles of the behavioural sciences.</p><p>The #ogilvychange team has developed an action plan to build on the work already being done by Blue Ventures, which applies behavioural insights to make condoms a more normal part of young people&rsquo;s sexual relationships in Madagascar. By incorporating their solutions into Blue Ventures&rsquo; existing programme activities, #ogilvychange has given them solutions that are easy to implement within their current budget, that activate all of their current resources for exposure and promotion, and that adds a new dimension to their existing sustainable fishing campaign &ndash; Vezo Aho.</p><p>Based on the barriers to condom use identified by Blue Ventures&rsquo; research and with insights from the #ogilvychange team, their solutions were designed to fulfil the following aims:</p><ul><li>To create a self-perpetuating social norm of young people using condoms</li><li>To develop a strategy for young people to refuse sex without a condom</li><li>To remove the barriers of price and availability</li></ul><p><strong>Highlights of the solutions developed by #ogilvychange:</strong></p><p><strong>I am Vezo</strong><br\/> Blue Ventures' existing campaign, called 'Vezo Aho', meaning 'I am Vezo', uses the power of social identity to encourage Vezo communities to use sustainable fishing practices. #ogilvychange expressed the importance of harnessing the powerful message of the &lsquo;I am Vezo&rsquo; campaign to promote safer sex as an act of protecting the community, which is after all the responsibility of every Vezo.</p><p>The #ogilvychange team developed plans for extending the &lsquo;I am Vezo&rsquo; campaign to include communities making a public commitment to pledge to look after their bodies as well as their fishing heritage. Using the power of &ldquo;priming&rdquo;, #ogilvychange suggested creating an association between their commitment to Vezo Aho and condom use, cleanliness and social responsibility. This could be done by offering information about condom use and making condoms available at communal washing areas, as well as offering condom holders with the Vezo Aho branding on them to reinforce the message.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/condom_holder.jpg\" alt=\"Branding idea to support Blue Ventures\"\/></p><p><strong>Refusing sex without a condom</strong><br\/> A campaign concept was developed to make it easier for boys to ask their friends for a condom if they are without one in order to entrench condom use as a healthy norm, and a parallel idea was developed for girls to become more comfortable refusing sex without a condom. These campaigns will be promoted through radio dramatisations, youth clubs and working with influential community members to start new trends.</p><p><strong>The cost</strong><br\/> Most important is for condoms to be readily available at an affordable price, so as well as advising Blue Ventures to make condoms available for free where that is possible, the #ogilvychange team put forward suggestions for a new pricing structure to sell hormonal pills and condoms together as a combined package so that condoms are not seen as an optional extra, or creating monthly subscription packages for condoms to make their sustained use more automatic. They also suggested that practical demonstrations of how to use condoms should be offered so that young people won&rsquo;t feel they are wasting money on buying something that they may not know how to use properly.</p><p><strong>Turning ideas into action</strong></p><p><strong></strong>We caught up with Caroline Savitzky, the health programme coordinator for Blue Ventures based in southwest Madagascar, who is now developing their work based on the input from #ogilvychange. She said, &ldquo;The recommendations from #ogilvychange are proving extremely helpful, not just for our condom behaviour change communication work but also for Blue Ventures&rsquo; overall social marketing and community education strategies.</p><p>&ldquo;We have begun implementing some of the solutions proposed by #ogilvychange, including looking into how to use the idea of having a pledge of commitment to safer sex, linked with a public statement and something physical - either a bracelet, branded t-shirt or condom holder key ring. We are also considering how to most appropriately build on the success of the &ldquo;Vezo Aho&rdquo; campaign when working with more ethnically diverse groups through our health programme.</p><p>&ldquo;We are reviewing our condom pricing structure and will be changing our approach to this within our supply chain limits. Practice sessions and free condoms to practice with are now being offered both in outreach clinics and through one-to-one distribution at bars. This has been found to be very popular, and we have two very committed male peer educators and four female community-based distributors providing these services.</p><p>&ldquo;We are rethinking our approach to focus not just on health messages but on the \"coolness factor\" as #ogilvychange suggested, in order to create a self-perpetuating norm of condom use among young people in our partner communities.&rdquo;</p><p>Currently 98% of these young people lose their virginity without using a condom. If this high percentage can be reduced over time, this will set new precedents for their sexual behaviour and they will be more likely to continue using them in the future.</p><p>Blue Ventures will continue to implement the behaviour change solutions proposed by #ogilvychange over the coming months and we will keep you updated on their progress.</p><p>If Blue Ventures can use #ogilvychange&rsquo;s solutions to make the same kind of impact on sexual health through condom use as they have already made with addressing unmet family planning needs through other contraceptives, it will greatly benefit the health and well-being of these coastal people as well the marine environment on which their livelihoods depend.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

I stepped back from FrontlineSMS in the summer of 2012, handing day-to-day control over to a couple of colleagues based out of our Washington DC and Nairobi offices. It felt like the right time to pass the reigns over to a new team, and I felt I'd taken the project as far as I could. The management transition was something of a rare event in the technology-for-development world I live in, and it was covered in a few places, including the <a href=\"http://www.clearlyso.com/blog/3905/A%20lesson%20from%20rock%20aristocracy\" target=\"_blank\">ClearlySo website</a>. FrontlineSMS has gone from strength to strength since, launching new versions of the platform, attracting increasing funding, and attracting some great new team members.<br\/> <br\/> FrontlineSMS took up eight years of my life, so stepping back left a gap. I returned to consultancy to earn a living, and am currently working with the likes of the GSM Association, Ushahidi and PopTech on a range of initiatives, all with a social and/or technology component. I also published a book, <em><a href=\"http://www.reluctantinnovation.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Rise of the Reluctant Innovator</a></em>, as it became clear that I had an increasing role to play in helping other start-ups and social innovators get their ideas off the ground. The book, which comes with a foreword from Archbishop Desmond Tutu, has been picked up by a number of colleges and universities. It also hit top spot in Amazon's \"Development Studies\" chart earlier this year.&nbsp;<br\/> <br\/><strong>Paul: How has your thinking evolved over that period?</strong><br\/> <br\/>Ken: My career in international development spans 21 years, with the more recent focus on technology (in particular mobile phones) covering the last decade. Over that time I've become increasingly despondent with the official aid sector, and frustrated by the lack of progress despite the huge budgets and level of resources available to it. I've regularly written about those frustrations, and tried to give pointers on where I think we're going wrong, and how we might put them right. One thing I didn't want to do was become that grumpy old man sitting in the corner shouting about how rubbish everything was, so I've made a conscious effort to focus my thinking positively. <em>The Rise of the Reluctant Innovator</em> is the result of that focus. The book looks at the contribution that lone rangers, hackers and everyday people are making to solving some of the bigger problems around the world. In stark contrast to the development sector, many of these innovators have few resources, and little money, yet they often produce more meaningful solutions. I find this interesting, and the book seeks to encourage people interested in making the world a better place to take action, and to make meaningful action feel achievable. As Archbishop Tutu writes in his foreword, it is a book of \"hope, inspiration, and a beacon of what's possible\".<br\/> <br\/><strong>Paul: What is the relevance of your work to small and medium sized charities and social enterprises?</strong><br\/> <br\/>Ken: Many social enterprises are trying to make sense of technology, and make sense of an emerging trend of disruptive individuals building solutions to big problems \"outside of the system\", often using this technology. Many see this trend as a threat, so understanding where grassroots social innovation comes from, and how they might be able to foster a better environment where innovation can thrive, is important. In parallel, we're seeing a growing trend of 'intrapreneurship', where staff are encouraged to be entrepreneurial in their day-to-day roles. No-one has a monopoly on solving the world's problems, and there's enough poverty to go round, so we need as many people as possible focused on them, and as many young, talented people as possible interested in joining them.</p><p><strong>Paul: We ask each of our interviewees to browse our profiles of member causes and choose one to give a few words of advice or a creative idea to &ndash; which cause would you like to choose and what advice would you like to give them?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Ken: I'm a big fan of <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/1849\" target=\"_blank\">The Hackney Pirates</a>, whose beliefs in the power of education and youth empowerment closely mirrors my own. I also like <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/2388\" target=\"_blank\">Taking on the Giant</a>, which uses stories from young people to help promote entrepreneurship and social change among youth.<br\/> <br\/><strong>Paul: What ideas or suggestions would you give to these causes based on your approach?<br\/> </strong><br\/>Ken: Quite often organisations begin life innovative, and it's often their new approach to a problem which gives them the early traction. After that, continuing the innovation theme gets progressively more difficult. For these organisations, I'd suggest the following tips to help them buck that trend:<br\/> <br\/> 1. Give staff the freedom to think, try new things, or come up with new ideas. That could be in time - half a day each week to be creative - or through regular meetings and brainstorming sessions.<br\/> <br\/> 2. Try to build a culture of 'intrapreneurship' within your organisation.<br\/> <br\/> 3. Encourage staff to take a pen and paper to bed with them. Ideas come at the most unexpected times.<br\/> <br\/> 4. Run competitions, or internal events. Bring in external speakers, ideally from different sectors, to educate and inspire.<br\/> <br\/> 5. Encourage an atmosphere of collaboration and sharing, not competition between staff members.<br\/> <br\/> 6. Run a book club. Produce a reading list for staff (books which ideally touch on innovation, inspiration, entrepreneurship) and hold book discussions/presentations. Subsidise the costs of the books.<br\/> <br\/> 7. Allow the staff to shape any 'innovation-themed' initiatives. Let them own it. Engaged staff will always be more productive.<br\/> <br\/> Different things work for different organisations, and there are no quick fixes. Many more can be gleaned from the many books which have been written on the subject, including mine.</p>"

The platform, with the cheeky name Pimp My Cause, is a place where nonprofits and charities, along with professional marketers &mdash; strategists, graphic designers and PR pros &mdash; fill out applications and shop for just the right match.<\/p> <p>The idea came when Skinner was doing pro bono work for two or three causes a year while he was working as a professional marketer on campaigns for big companies like L 'Oreal in their Paris headquarters. He could only do so much on his own, and he wanted to create a \"multiplier effect.\"</p><p>Since he started U.K.-based Pimp My Cause in 2011, over 1,000 nonprofits and charities from the U.S. and the U.K. have posted profiles to the site, along with hundreds of marketers from Endinburgh to Chicago. Skinner estimates that they have completed $5 million of pro bono work for causes, and since every dollar spent on marketing comes out to about $5 in benefit, that comes to $25 million worth of benefits to date.</p><p>\"I wanted to go beyond my own slender resources, and it shows how you can raise the ceiling,\" says Skinner. \"It's about scale.\"</p><p><strong>Combining powers</strong></p><p>Conservation group&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.blueventures.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Blue Ventures</a>&nbsp;works in places where the ocean is vital to local people &mdash; and takes a science-based approach to creating sustainable marine and aquaculture practices.

After launching an education campaign, it conducted a survey and found that 88 percent of people said that condoms protect against STIs. The only problem? Only 15 percent said they actually used them.</p><p>The gap in behavior was perplexing. \"Basically, we had to figure out a way to make it cool,\" says founder Alasdair Harris.</p><p>Pimp My Cause matched Blue Ventures with brand marketing giant Ogilvy, whose #ogilvychange team helped it come up with a strategy to make condom use \"normal,\" by using Blue Ventures' existing campaign, called \"Vezo Aho,\" meaning \"I am Vezo,\" that used social identity to encourage Vezos to use sustainable fishing practices.</p><p>The campaign would extend the association of community pride to condom use, and promote it through providing condoms at communal washing areas, and sponsoring radio PSA's. Bracelets &mdash; aka the ubiquitous yellow Lance Armstrong \"Live Strong\" arm bands, would promote solidarity and identity.</p><p>\"They [Ogilvy] talked about how behavior is often socially located. It's not about encouraging the individual, it's about social norms. We were struggling in this area before we got their take on it,\" says Harris.</p><p><strong>The NGO of the future</strong></p><p>Ogilvy's expertise in social psychology and behavior change is valuable to Harris, who is no slouch himself &mdash; he&rsquo;s a marine biologist and visiting post-doctoral researcher at the University of Oxford, an advisor to the U.N. Environment Program, has won international awards for his conservation and sustainability work, and was commended in the &ldquo;Enterprising Young Brits&rsquo; awards.</p><p>The combining of unique talents and knowledge is all part of the pay-off for Skinner, who sees Pimp My Cause as a collaboration generator, which he sees as a model for the \"NGO of the future.\"</p><p>Skinner sees collaboration as replacing the competitive model of the past in which organizations hired talent and tried to keep it internal. Instead, companies, and especially NGOs, should be looking to borrow talent outside of their organization, he says. \"There's much more talent and know-how outside a group than inside &mdash; and smart NGOs will be looking to partner with those people.\"</p><p><strong>What's in it for volunteers</strong></p><p>Not all pro bono or CSR is the same, says Harris of Blue Ventures.</p><p>He's received some \"ludicrous offers from feel-good initiatives,\" he says, citing one Tuesday afternoon when he received a \"pompous email\" from Shell saying that some executives would drop by Thursday morning for a few hours. He ignored it.</p><p>\"Then they get to tell their shareholders that they're doing something good in Africa,\" he says. \"We have a lot more education than most MBAs.\"</p><p>But effective partnerships come about when pro-bono volunteers are into a project for the long haul, or offer a unique skill set.</p><p>Matt Eller, who just graduated from Vanderbilt University in May, found that he had skills that nonprofits need, and they gave him something in return &mdash; job experience. Eller wanted to start a career in graphic design, but his portfolio was thin. The 22-year-old from Chicago found Pimp My Cause on the Internet and decided that if he was going to do work for cheap, he wanted it to be \"for a good cause.\"</p><p>\"A lot of artists will really undersell and do cheap work for a client that doesn't care,\" he says. \"Instead of doing a $5 logo, I can do a full contract and make it official for pro bono.\"</p><p>Eller did a pro-bono logo campaign for Elephant Daze &mdash; an organization fighting elephant extinction. He's done another project since then, for HEAL, a group that offers help for domestic violence victims. Now Eller has two complete projects &mdash; one that's international &mdash; to show clients.</p><p>Steve Walker, a former head of marketing for Sony mobile, says that pro bono opportunities like those at Pimp My Cause are a perfect proving ground for young marketers where they have the ultimate challenge of working with a \"budget of zero.\"</p><p>To view the full article go to:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://national.deseretnews.com/article/2148/pimp-my-cause-matches-marketers-with-causes.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://national.deseretnews.com/article/2148/pimp-my-cause-matches-marketers-with-causes.html</a></p>"

  "content": "<h2 align=\"center\">Marketing the Health Lows of Legal Highs</h2><p><br\/> Hester Stewart was a 21-year-old student on target to get a first class honours degree in molecular medicine who went out for an evening to celebrate with her cheerleading team after an awards ceremony in 2009.</p><p>During the evening an old boyfriend convinced her to try GBL, which at the time was an unclassified substance or legal high (also known as a New Psychoactive Substance). Combined with the alcohol she had consumed, the drug had the effect of shutting down her respiratory system. Hester fell asleep, went into a coma and died. Her friends and family were shocked by the news and by the fact that something so deadly could be bought legally.</p><p>Hester&rsquo;s mother, Maryon Stewart, responded to the tragedy by trying to stop the same thing from happening to others. She founded the <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/2509\" target=\"_blank\">Angelus Foundation</a>, the only organisation in the world that is dedicated to raising awareness of the dangers of legal highs. In the past five years she has campaigned with great energy, educating young people about the dangers of these substances.<br\/> <br\/> The Angelus Foundation works hard to reach young people and their parents with simple and direct messages about the high risk of taking these unpredictable substances. Their goal is to educate young people, through online information and films to at least find out more before deciding whether or not to take legal highs.<br\/> <br\/> In August of last year, Maryon signed the Angelus Foundation up to Pimp My Cause looking for support with creating a social media campaign. The organisation has made several films about the consequences of taking these risky substances and had recently created a new comedy film called <em>Lab Rats</em> aimed at educating young people about the type of people who sell legal highs.<br\/> <br\/><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Km2UMK04ms8\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe><br\/> <br\/> Through Pimp My Cause Maryon and her team connected with <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/professionals/more_information/2505\" target=\"_blank\">Sophie Hill</a>, a social media and digital marketing professional.<br\/> <br\/> Angelus CEO Jan King said, &ldquo;We knew we needed to connect with young people and that there was a huge potential audience on social media platforms, but we didn&rsquo;t know how best to engage them.&rdquo;<br\/> <br\/> Sophie helped the Angelus team develop their plans for launching the <em>Lab Rats</em> film into a coherent social media campaign that would help them to build up their social media followers in order to make the most of the film.<br\/> <br\/> Sophie advised the team to break the <em>Lab Rats</em> film down into bite-sized teaser clips that they could use to generate social buzz before launching the full three-minute film. She helped them to understand how best to connect to their target audience and together they developed their key message for the campaign.<br\/> <br\/> Jan said, &ldquo;Sophie has taught us a great deal about digital marketing. It was incredibly helpful to get her advice on what was realistic in terms of our goals for the number of people that we wanted to reach with the campaign and how best to meet those objectives. Our interns were able to implement the advice she gave us and she helped them to exploit the marketing materials that we already had. Working with Sophie we felt that we were in incredibly safe hands.&rdquo;<br\/> <br\/> Sophie said, &ldquo;After finding out more about the work that Angelus does for young people and the incredible story behind the foundation, I was determined to help spread such a vital message. I would like to thank both Maryon and Jan for giving me the opportunity to share my knowledge and help to improve their social media presence. The Angelus team has been an absolute pleasure to work with. The Lab Rats campaign was a great success and I hope to continue working with the Angelus Foundation.&rdquo;<br\/> <br\/> The campaign ran from October to December and culminated in the launch of the full <em>Lab Rats</em> film. The campaign generated over 18,000 views and helped to get the message out that the people behind so-called legal highs are not in any way regulated and the products have not been tested, so they are in effect using the people who buy their products as lab rats.<br\/> <br\/> Jeff Leach, an actor and comedian who lost his best friend Louise to party drugs, wrote the script for <em>Lab Rats</em> as well as appearing in it. \"Young People are curious and adventurous but it's imperative to educate them about the vast risks involved in using legal highs. Why should more young lives be lost through a lack of education?\" &nbsp;<br\/> <br\/> Irwin Sparks, the lead singer of the Hoosiers and co-performer in <em>Lab Rats</em> said \"making people aware of the dangers inherent in legal highs is vital work that I'm happy to be part of.\"<br\/> <br\/> Legal highs often contain inconsistent ingredients or mixtures. When the Government bans one drug, the producers of legal highs simply alter its chemical structure slightly and start supplying a new substance. Because they change so often it is an uphill battle to tackle them through the usual legislation, so the Angelus Foundation has focussed on educating parents and young people about the dangers of legal highs.<br\/> <br\/> Angelus surveys show 95% of people that have viewed Angelus&rsquo; films said that the film changed how they felt about legal highs.<br\/> <br\/> Find out more through their websites:<br\/> <br\/><a href=\"http://www.angelusfoundation.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.angelusfoundation.com/</a></p><p><a href=\"http://whynotfindout.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.whynotfindout.org/</a></p>"

A powerful win-win-win that benefits the team, the cause and society.</p><p>We supported the PHE team in developing their ideas into a practical plan. And together we designed a programme that gave their team the experience of working as a creative agency for our causes.</p><p>This gave them the opportunity to gain a new perspective, which could help them to better understand and manage their own agency relationships, which could translate into better directed and more purposeful creative work and as a direct consequence lead to improved health outcomes for the public.</p><p>This Challenge was also a chance for team members to further develop their pitching and presenting skills and to develop campaign ideas that can engage stakeholders and participants at a variety of levels including through grass roots programmes with very little budget.</p><p>The PHE national marketing team is made up of a campaign activation team, a planning team and a partnerships team. Members of these three teams were mixed up to make six new groups ready to take on the marketing Challenges presented by our causes.</p><p>To maximise the positive outcome for the causes and to make the experience as relevant as possible to Public Health England&rsquo;s marketing team the causes were selected from the Pimp My Cause membership, with a focus on charities and social enterprises that relate to medical and health issues.</p><p>Three causes were chosen by PHE and the groups of their marketers developed communications and engagement campaign ideas to help them reach their goals.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/phe_causes.jpg\" alt=\"Causes to benefit from Public Health England marketing Challenge\"\/></p><p><a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/1672\" target=\"_blank\">Greenwich &amp; Bexley Community Hospice</a>, a 20-year-old charity asked for help with ideas for how to engage more local people with life-limited illnesses and their families in using their services and how to attract more volunteer support. <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/57\" target=\"_blank\">Upbeat</a>, a music and mental health charity with Coldplay at patrons, asked for help with engaging more supporters. And <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/1343\" target=\"_blank\">SportInspired</a>, a social enterprise that helps children across the UK find a sport they love, asked for campaign ideas for how to keep more of their participants engaged with their organisation for longer.</p><p>In a short amount of time the PHE marketing groups were able to develop straight forward practical, high impact plans for the causes to follow. For example one of the teams made a significant contribution to Upbeat&rsquo;s overall marketing and communications by suggesting a change in language from trying to attract &ldquo;supporters&rdquo; to &ldquo;fans&rdquo;. This apparently simple change taps into what is unique about Upbeat, which is their use of music to support recovery from mental health issues and their celebrity contacts. And by developing their brand using the language of music, the PHE group argued they would have more success connecting with people who were naturally enthusiastic about their cause.</p><p>The proposition the group put forward for their campaign was to &ldquo;Join the world&rsquo;s biggest band to jam in Camden and improve mental health through music.&rdquo; They developed this proposition further into plans for a &ldquo;Big Busk&rdquo; to raise money for Upbeat.</p><p>One group developed a plan for how SportInspired could build its grassroots movement by engaging parents, a group they had previously not connected with. Their message for parents was &ldquo;SportInpired makes it easy to keep your children happy and active.&rdquo; And the group developed plans for a family kit to involve parents in expanding the impact of SportInspired Games and with the added benefit of keeping participants engaged with their programmes for longer.</p><p>A member of the PHE partnerships team also recognised ways for SportInspired to potentially work with them on Change4Life, the well-known social marketing campaign to stop obesity, and they will be following up on that possibility.</p><p>Another group developed a campaign idea for Greenwich &amp; Bexley Community Hospice, which would encourage potential volunteers to donate their &ldquo;extra&rdquo; hour in March 2015 when the clocks go forward. The campaign headline would be &ldquo;What can you do in an hour?&rdquo;. And once a volunteer has contributed an hour of their time, the group argued it would be much easier to get them involved in longer term volunteering projects for the hospice.</p><p>Feedback from the Challenge was very positive. All the participants felt they gained a lot from working with their cause partners. They said it was a unique opportunity for them to use their marketing skills in a challenging new way that led to real world benefits for people in need.</p><p>Anna Springbett, co-director of SportInspired said about their involvement in the programme, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come a long way with our marketing and that is thanks to you.&rdquo;</p>"

This year their challenge consists of 14 days of cycling 1,200 miles, attempting to break the &ldquo;Three peaks on bikes&rdquo; world record and kayaking 145 miles down the River Thames. The purpose of their 2015 challenge is to raise money for two charities;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.gladshouse.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Glad&rsquo;s House</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wateraid.org/uk\" target=\"_blank\">WaterAid</a>.</p><p>To maximise the amount of potential funds raised for their chosen charities they sought pro bono marketing support through Pimp my Cause.

This will be a total climb of 29 miles with 450 miles of cycling between the peaks. As part of the challenge the team will also circumnavigate Great Britain by cycling and kayaking over 1,200 miles in 12 days. See below for a graphical representation of the charity challenge route.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/infographic_for_challenges4change.jpg\" alt=\"Infographic created by pro bono marketer through Pimp My Cause\"\/></p><p>The challenge is supporting Glad&rsquo;s House, which helps street children in Kenya to find a home and support with education and training. And Water Aid, which works to improve access to safe water, hygiene and sanitation in some of the world&rsquo;s poorest communities.</p><p>Andrew has worked with the challenge team and the two charities to develop an integrated PR campaign consisting of a news release, photo call, a target online and offline media list and a graphical representation of the charity challenge. The campaign has already started to gain great traction online, in the press and radio, with more coverage expected as the challenge unfolds.</p><p>The ambitious challenge starts at London&rsquo;s Tower Bridge on Saturday May 30th where the team will cycle 650 miles to Ben Nevis, from which they will make the 10.5 mile climb up Scotland&rsquo;s highest mountain. Then there is a 250 miles cycle south to Scafell Pike in the Lake District for a 9.3 miles ascent. Then a cycle of 200 miles to Snowdon in Wales for the last climb of 7 miles and a 150 mile cycle to Gloucester. Once at Gloucester the team will start a 145 mile kayak down the River Thames to the finish line at London&rsquo;s Tower Bridge.</p><p>Mike Cannon from Challenges4Change commented, \"We are delighted to already have gained great media coverage from the campaign and to be engaging new donors. The feedback from the public, colleagues and friends has been very positive. Our thanks to Andrew for creating the PR campaign, raising our brand awareness and engaging donors for our pending challenge&rdquo;.</p><p>Andrew said, &ldquo;It was great to have the opportunity to work with Challenges4Change in the support of their pending challenge. The support provided clearly pales in significance to the feat they are about to&nbsp;undertake. My thanks to Challenges4Change and Glad&rsquo;s House, for the opportunity to contribute&nbsp;in some limited way to the great work they do. I look forward to any further opportunities where I ca&#8203;n offer any marketing or public relations expertise.&rdquo;</p><p>Challenges4Change are no strangers to challenges of this magnitude, having cycled 6000 miles from London&rsquo;s Tower Bridge to Kenya in 2011 which took them through 18 countries in 99 days. Then in 2013 they climbed the highest peak in Western Europe, Mont Blanc, whilst cycling 600 miles across France and running 82 miles from Dover to Tower Bridge in 12 days all in support of charity.</p><p>For more information about the world record charity challenge go to:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://goo.gl/7oCJY0\" target=\"_blank\">http://goo.gl/7oCJY0</a>&#8203;</p>"

They signed up for the Sony Mobile Challenge because they wanted to find new ways to engage support for and raise funds for their StepUp programme.</p><p>StepUp is one of their key programmes and it focuses on helping subsistence farmers in northern Uganda to rebuild their homes and help their families out of poverty. The programme is based on providing training and opportunities in four areas: sustainable farming, sanitation and health, starting small businesses and community leadership.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/uganda.jpg\" alt=\"Sony marketers support refugees in Uganda\"\/><br\/><br\/>IRT&rsquo;s donor engagement strategy had been successful in the past, but like many of our causes it relied too heavily on an aging population. Their Sony team helped them to analyse the StepUp programme to see what potential donor groups it could appeal to.<br\/><br\/>With its successful long-term focus on self-sufficiency the Sony group felt that the StepUp programme would appeal to businesses looking to engage in CSR activities with charities that are providing tangible results.<br\/><br\/>The Sony team helped Katie Kurilecz, Fundraising and Marketing Manager at IRT, to develop a strategy to engage west London businesses (near IRT&rsquo;s offices) in supporting StepUp. Their plans included a direct mailing campaign, in which a packet of seeds could be sent to businesses to interest them in how families in Uganda are learning to rebuild their own lives through training in better farming methods.<br\/><br\/>Katie said, &ldquo;Jo, our team leader from Sony, helped me to better understand how to get attention in the B2B market. I now ask myself with each piece of communication &ldquo;What do we want to get out of it?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What does the other person what to get out it?&rdquo;. This has helped me to make our messages clearer and stronger.&rdquo;<br\/><br\/>IRT&rsquo;s Sony team was uncommonly dedicated to helping their cause and they have continued to support IRT&rsquo;s work long after the official Challenge ended.<br\/><br\/>The Sony team also recruited support from their agency partners HeyHuman. The creative team from HeyHuman helped IRT to refine their message and develop new visual methods of telling the StepUp story. Katie is currently working with a graphic designer through Pimp My Cause to implement the storytelling ideas that were developed.<br\/><br\/>Katie said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where we would be today without the support from Sony.&rdquo;<br\/><br\/>Although they feel their marketing has come a long way in the last year, IRT is still looking to make further improvements and if anyone is interested in supporting them with their digital communications they would love to hear from you. Please email anna@pimpmycause.org if you are interested supporting IRT.</p>"

  "content": "<h2>Marketing Week features Pimp My Cause</h2><p>Below are experts from a recent <a href=\"http://www.marketingweek.com/2015/07/02/six-leadership-skills-you-can-gain-from-volunteering/\" target=\"_blank\">Marketing Week article featuring Pimp My Cause</a>.</p><h2>Six leadership skills you can gain from volunteering</h2><p><span>By Maeve Hosea, published on July 2, 2015</span><br\/><br\/><span>Voluntary work can offer rewarding experiences and opportunities, particularly for ambitious marketers who are keen to develop leadership skills and build strong networks within the industry.</span><br\/><br\/><span>2. Learning from new environments</span><br\/><br\/><span>Getting involved with people in the voluntary sector is an eye opener in many ways. While they might want guidance in areas, charity workers, who are often highly skilled and have a clear vision of what they want to achieve, have plenty to teach too.</span><br\/><br\/><span>One of the most important lessons for young marketers is arguably the often-limited resources they are presented with in such scenarios and how that challenge can be a springboard for effective marketing.</span><br\/><br\/><span>&ldquo;You can learn more than you think by working with charities and social enterprises,&rdquo; says Catherine Cherry, marketing director, UK, Ireland and Netherlands at Sony Mobile Communications. She donates the time of her marketing team to small charities as part of an annual &lsquo;challenge&rsquo; event in partnership with Pimp My Cause, a web-based platform bringing good causes in need of professional marketing support together with experts.</span></p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/sony_heyhuman.jpg\" alt=\"Catherine Cherry working with her team at Sony Mobile\"\/></p><p><br\/><span>&ldquo;Part of it is having the chance to apply your marketing expertise in a new environment. Working with small budgets forces you to think creatively and challenges the return on investment in every idea,&rdquo; says Cherry.</span><br\/><br\/><span>The brand donates two days per year to the partnership: one for creating the marketing plan and the other as a follow-up day, where it brainstorms creative ideas that the charities can execute based on their plan. The people involved range through all levels, from Cherry herself at director level, to marketing assistants and executives. She recommends that young marketers volunteer because of the guaranteed learning opportunity the initiative offers.</span><br\/><br\/><span>&ldquo;For less experienced marketers, it&rsquo;s a wonderful opportunity to learn from others, to work with senior people they wouldn&rsquo;t normally get to spend time with and to work across the entire marketing plan &ndash; unlike their day jobs, which often focus on specialist functions.&rdquo;</span><br\/><br\/><span>3. Building confidence and passion</span><br\/><br\/><span>Giving is at the core of volunteering but there is much that can be gained from it too. Yes To Life is a charity that works with cancer sufferers to help them access an integrated approach to their treatment. Approaching its 10th birthday, it is aiming to improve its loyalty offering for supporters.</span><br\/><br\/><span>Loyalty programme Nectar works with Pimp My Cause under the banner of Loyalty for Good and is mid-way through a nine-month project with Yes to Life. It has helped with the charity&rsquo;s anniversary celebration in June this year, as well as a project to strengthen its relationships with both the business partners it works with and the people who make donations to the charity.</span><br\/><br\/><span>Nectar partner manager Jeannine Trim, who has worked for the loyalty brand since graduating in 2011, has cultivated a passion for the cause while working on a series of pro bono campaigns for Yes to Life. &ldquo;I was really attracted by how different its approach to cancer is,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Added to that, the brief fits well with what we do because they want to</span><br\/><span>build relationships with not only people donating to them, but other businesses.&rdquo;</span><br\/><br\/><span>Trim works with a team of seven other Nectar marketers from different levels within the business on the project, meeting weekly and receiving training concurrently. &ldquo;You will learn new skills on the training scheme and you will be able to implement them straight away, which is helpful,&rdquo; she explains. &ldquo;It gives you confidence in ideas; confidence that you are the expert &ndash; you may be a young, comparatively inexperienced marketer, but you are still an expert in your field.&rdquo;</span><br\/><br\/><span>5. The opportunity to make a difference</span><br\/><br\/><span>With the transition to digital, charities and social enterprises need good marketing more than ever.</span><br\/><br\/><span>Andrew Nixon-King, programme manager at Liberty Mutual Insurance, has volunteered for a number of organisations including Glad&rsquo;s House, which supports children living below the poverty line in Kenya, and Wise Up Workshops, which provides drawing and talk therapy to children. He has donated his website and search engine optimisation skills, as well as inbound marketing strategies to improve performance.</span><br\/><br\/><span>His intention behind volunteering is about giving back in a small way, but it has also made a meaningful contribution to his own career development agenda.</span><br\/><br\/><span>&ldquo;Volunteering has boosted my self-confidence and self-esteem because making a corner of the world a better place really adds a sense of accomplishment,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;It has also tested my ability to lead under tough time-sensitive circumstances, with limited resources and no direct authority. I&rsquo;m certain these added value experiences will help progress my career in the future.&rdquo;</span><br\/><br\/><span>Nixon-King has gained confidence from working on projects which have made a very tangible difference to people&rsquo;s lives. This in turn has helped him with motivation, given him inspiration, made him a more rounded person and prepared him for future leadership.</span><br\/><br\/><span>&ldquo;A good leader has exemplary character &ndash; it is someone with honesty, integrity, vision and the ability to make a difference,&rdquo; says Nixon-King. &ldquo;Volunteering without doubt adds character and helps build upon these core leadership values.&rdquo;</span></p>"

They sought to develop a communications plan with the right propositions to engage their most important stakeholders. These include all types of professionals in London, young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, parents and community organisations that could become partners to help them deliver a greater impact.</p><p>Rachael Box, co-founder of LVN said, &ldquo;Catherine really helped LVN gain focus which has meant we are now a lot clearer in our offering. She truly understood our aims and objectives and has used her expertise to help us communicate more effectively.</p><p>&ldquo;She has helped us to develop our presentation to professionals who may be interested in donating their time at our events. And she has helped us to develop a brief with the changes needed to our website to make it simpler and clearer for anyone wanting to find out about us and our events&rdquo;.</p><p>Catherine said. &ldquo;It's been great working with Rachael and LVN. They have such an incredible purpose and I really appreciated being able to contribute to their work. I will definitely keep in touch and plan to continue supporting them.&rdquo;</p><p>LVN has now connected with Anureet Sra from&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.thecouturewebdesigner.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Couture Web Limited</a>, a&nbsp;web developer they met through Pimp My Cause, who is helping them to implement the recommended changes to their website. We look forward to sharing that work with you soon.</p>"

And they have also helped to develop the marketing capabilities of the causes' staff themselves, so that they are better able to implement the plans after the Challenge.</p><p>The teams have also inspired other Aimia employees to give their time to their cause partners where needed. For example they have recruited specialists to build a CRM database for Ambition; social media experts to promote Sky Badger's School Baking Competition; and have engaged the business development team at Nectar Card to train Yes to Life in pitching their charity to potential partners.</p><p>This programme has contributed to Aimia&rsquo;s talent development objectives of building stronger innovation capabilities by supporting the Nectar Partnerships team with training in innovation and strategic thinking and then giving them the immediate opportunity to put this training into practice through the work with their charity partners.</p><p>The Challenge officially ended this month and it is clear to see that the teams have achieved breakthrough success by helping the causes to development the resources and capabilities to build valuable relationships that will ultimately help the causes to raise more funds, engage and retain customers and develop successful partnerships.</p><p>We will be following the progress of each of these causes over the coming weeks and months, so look out for individual stories about the impacts of this Challenge.&nbsp;</p>"

We have since expanded our partnership with Ogilvy to collaborate with a broader range of their specialist teams. This has included a unique opportunity for one of our causes to work with OgilvyOne and School21 as part of a real world learning project.</p><p>As part of this project three Year 10 students from School21 joined OgilvyOne as interns for a total of 16 weeks and their group choose to work with <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/2926\" target=\"_blank\">London Village Network (LVN)</a>. The students were given a brief to create and launch a social media campaign for LVN. And H&amp;O and Ogilvy Change also got involved in bringing the campaign to life and maximising its impact.&nbsp;</p><p>Today they launched a hard hitting social media campaign<strong> </strong>to drive awareness and act as a deterrent against young people getting involved with knife crime. The purpose of the campaign is to show young people the harsh reality of prison life and to then explain that LVN is there to support young people to make better choices.</p><p>\"It is terrifying to think that a split-second, impulsive decision - to carry a knife - can cause such appalling consequences for so many people. If there is one decision which behavioural science should aspire to change, it is this one,\" Said Rory Sutherland Executive Creative Director of OgilvyOne and co-founder of the Behavioural Sciences Practice.</p><p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m1jdh2RSswk\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe></p><p>Featuring in the video (above) is a 44 year old man who spent 21 years in prison for knife crime.

It&rsquo;s a trend that needs to be reversed before it grows out of control. London Village Network is a new grass roots charity that is determined to stop this from becoming an inevitable part of London life. It was founded by two women from within an estate community who were ready to make a stand, help give these young people self-worth and communicate the true consequences of knife crime, helping our youth to see and explore the choices around.&nbsp; Since 2015 the charity has excelled all expectations and the youth engagement has been a huge success.&nbsp;</p><p>LVN&rsquo;s campaign with OgilvyOne and School21 asks Londoners to &lsquo;Get Involved&rsquo; and show young people that they have a choice. The main request is for 3 hours of your time but there are lots of ways to help including offering venue space, providing much needed funds or uploading your inspirational story on social media using <strong>#myLVNpledge #LVNStopTheKnife.</strong></p><p>&ldquo;We need volunteers to come and talk to small groups of young people about what you do. It might sound very basic, but you&rsquo;ll be amazed at the influence it can have on someone who doesn&rsquo;t normally get to meet adults with regular jobs&rdquo; Said Liz Izzet Co-Founder of LVN. &ldquo;We want you to be natural, honest and authentic, so there is no format to follow or rules about what to say. You may have been passionate about your field of work from a young age or you may have fallen into it by chance &ndash; either way we just want to hear the story about how you got your job and what&rsquo;s good about it.&rdquo;</p><p>Young Londoners have a choice.

  "content": "<h2 align=\"center\"><strong>Leading marketer helps small charities find the right </strong></h2><h2 align=\"center\"><strong>path to growth</strong></h2><p>What is really holding your small charity or social enterprise back from reaching it&rsquo;s fullest potential?</p><p>Sometimes the answers may not be the ones you are expecting and it takes the opinion of an outside business leader to help you see the areas that need the most focus and improvement to support growth. Over the last several months two charities have had the benefit of being supported by Stuart Wilson, Group Partner and Group Head of Marketing of <a href=\"http://www.shirlawsgroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Shirlaws Group</a>, which supports private enterprise during their journey to grow, fund and exit to realise their life&rsquo;s work and he is former Chief Marketing Officer of Burton&rsquo;s Biscuits, the company behind Wagon Wheels, Jammie Dodgers and Cadbury&rsquo;s Biscuits.</p><p>Stuart connected with Pimp My Cause through <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/content/information/blog/pimp-my-cause-teams-up-with-the-marketing-society/54\" target=\"_blank\">The Marketing Society&rsquo;s Marketing for Good initiative</a> in 2015. We matched him up with the Lyme Regis Development Trust and SportInspired, who were both looking for help with their marketing and communications strategy.</p><p>What both organisations discovered early on in their relationship with Stuart was that to develop sustainable growth, what they most needed to focus on was more fundamental than they realized.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/2898\" target=\"_blank\">Lyme Regis Development Trust (LRDT)</a> is a fantastic organisation that is effectively a &lsquo;first stop&rsquo; for people in their local area wanting to make things better for themselves and their communities.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/lrdt_2.jpg\" alt=\"LRDT works with marketing expert Stuart Wilson\"\/></p><p>The charity was established 17 years ago and they are well thought of, even nationally, as an example of an innovative and ambitious Development Trust working in a small rural location.</p><p>They run a youth centre, an education and training centre, an affordable housing project and a careers advice and job club. They provide volunteering assistance, business start-up units, a community wifi caf&eacute;, support groups for mental health, a Fossil Festival and a foodbank and credit union.</p><p>You may be thinking that&rsquo;s an impressive range of services. It certainly is, but one marketing challenge associated with that is that their impacts are so diverse it&rsquo;s hard for them to communicate a clear, compelling proposition. Indeed, many people have heard of or used their services without even knowing who provides them. They asked Stuart to help them develop a more coherent communications strategy to raise awareness and engage new levels of support.</p><p>After exploring how LRDT works and its marketing, Stuart met with the board to help them move forward. He said they needed to dig deeper than their communications and start at the beginning with a coherent purpose, mission and vision for the organization that they could then build their strategy around.</p><p>Peter Jeffs, CEO of LRDT said, \"We have been delighted to work with Stuart, his experience has allowed us to focus on the things that are most important for marketing and growth and he has already started to give us some exciting new perspectives on both the messages and the methods\".</p><p>The second organization that Stuart has been working with is <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/1343\" target=\"_blank\">SportInspired</a>, an innovative charity that puts on SportInspired Games across the UK to help children find a sport they love.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/sportinspired_2.jpg\" alt=\"SportInspired works with marketing expert Stuart Wilson\"\/></p><p>Stuart supported SportInspired in focusing on their leadership strategy and has been coaching their leadership team for several months now to help them become the organization that they would like to be.</p><p>Anna Springbett, Director of SportInspired, said &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve met with Stuart regularly over several months and he&rsquo;s been coaching us broadly on our leadership as we respond to the opportunities available to us. He has gone above and beyond expectations to help us!&rdquo;</p><p>We asked Stuart about his experience working with LRDT and SportInspired and he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thoroughly enjoyed getting involved with two very different charities, particularly ones that I felt a personal connection to. It takes you out of your comfort zone working with very limited resource and creating social impacts. And I&rsquo;ve found that it&rsquo;s not just marketing expertise that you can bring to the table, all of your personal and business experience contributes greatly to helping them reach their goals. I would encourage marketers at all levels to take the opportunity to get involved, make a difference for individuals, organisations and communities and learn a lot about yourself and others along the way.&rdquo;</p>"

  "content": "<h2><span>Could marketing for good build better marketing teams?</span></h2><p><em>Originally published in the Market Leader magazine July 2016.</em></p><p><em>Article by&nbsp;Steve Walker, Learning and Development Ambassador at Pimp My Cause</em></p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/steve_walker.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Walker Learning and Development ambassador\"\/></p><p><span>When I was chief marketing officer at Sony Mobile, I found it comparatively easy to identify the learning and development needs of my team. However, it was much harder to find good, practical programmes that would allow them to develop their talents using real-world case studies.&nbsp;</span><br\/><br\/><span>So when I was introduced to Pimp My Cause through The Marketing Society&rsquo;s Marketing for Good initiative, I was struck by what an opportunity their unique position &ndash; connecting the marketing profession with charities &ndash; could provide for creating talent-development programmes with a difference.&nbsp;</span><br\/><span>&nbsp;</span><br\/><span>The founders of Pimp My Cause, Paul Skinner and Anna Mullenneaux, sought my advice on increasing the impact of their non-profit platform while making it more scalable and sustainable. For those of you who have not yet come across Pimp My Cause, it&rsquo;s a free digital service that acts a bit like online dating to connect marketers and charities who are looking to engage in pro bono projects.&nbsp;</span><br\/><span>&nbsp;</span><br\/><span>One of my professional passions is leadership development and, during an early session with the Pimp My Cause team, we identified an opportunity to create a unique type of training programme &ndash; giving corporate marketing teams from any type of business the chance to develop their capabilities by helping charities to overcome their own marketing challenges. From this brainstorming session, Pimp My Cause Challenges were born.&nbsp;</span><br\/><span>&nbsp;</span><br\/><span>They offer a really hands-on way to develop marketing skills while at the same time supporting a company&rsquo;s social-purpose agenda and increasing the impact of great causes. Each programme is tailor-made to fit the strategic priorities and talentdevelopment needs of the individual marketing team. Pimp My Cause specialises in finding inspiring causes with marketing needs that fit each particular Challenge, so that the causes involved take maximum advantage of the marketing support they gain and the learning outcomes are maximised for the marketers.&nbsp;</span><br\/><span>&nbsp;</span><br\/><span>Over the past two years, Pimp My Cause has deployed Challenges with corporate clients such as the Nectar team at Aimia, Public Health England and Sony. Each Challenge programme is unique. For example, with Public Health England the Challenge allowed its marketing team to act as an agency for its chosen charities, providing creative campaign ideas, while gaining a better understanding of its own agency partners.&nbsp;</span><br\/><span>&nbsp;</span><br\/><span>In Sony&rsquo;s case, they have run two Challenges: one to improve its long-term marketing planning and the second to improve brand development capabilities. In the process, it&rsquo;s given gamechanging marketing support to ten great causes.&nbsp;</span><br\/><span>&nbsp;</span><br\/><span>Speaking to the causes themselves, you quickly see what a difference this support makes to them. Katie Kurilecz, communications and fundraising manager at the International Refugee Trust, summarises this perfectly: &ldquo;Our Sony team helped us to refine our message and create a marketing plan that we are putting into action to engage new donors. This work is making a huge difference to the refugee families that desperately need our support.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><br\/><span>&nbsp;</span><br\/><span>Through a nine-month-long innovation Challenge with the Nectar Partnerships team at Aimia, five causes have been given transformational support in developing loyalty engagement programmes. Laurence Stock, the director of partnerships for Nectar at Aimia, explains some of the benefits they have gained: &ldquo;The Loyalty for Good Challenge has enabled us to mix up teams and break down any silos we may have had and also creates a flat structure so that everybody on the team has the opportunity to lead at some stage throughout the course of the year.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><br\/><span>&nbsp;</span><br\/><span>The Challenges are different to other training programmes in that they provide real-world opportunities to implement the skills being developed &ndash; which makes all the difference.&nbsp;</span><br\/><span>&nbsp;</span><br\/><span>As Pimp My Cause founder Paul Skinner puts it: &ldquo;Working with causes gives marketers the chance to accomplish success with very scarce resources. They often feel inspired by the cause they&rsquo;re supporting, which drives them to work harder to develop creative solutions to the cause&rsquo;s challenges. And it gives marketers the opportunity to feel good (or even better) about their own job and profession.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><br\/><span>&nbsp;</span><br\/><span>It&rsquo;s been really rewarding to support the team at Pimp My Cause. By creating these talentdevelopment programmes, they are now providing a valuable resource for the marketing profession as well as making Pimp My Cause more sustainable for the long term. And it&rsquo;s been immensely satisfying to see our Challenge plans successfully put into practice and making a difference to the causes, the marketers and their employers. It really is a win, win, win.&nbsp;</span><br\/><span>&nbsp;</span><br\/><span>And if that&rsquo;s not inspiring bolder marketing leadership, I don&rsquo;t know what is.&nbsp;</span><br\/><span>&nbsp;</span><br\/><span>Any marketer interested in finding a cause to support can do so for free through the Pimp My Cause website (pimpmycause.org) or, if they are a member of The Marketing Society, through the Marketing for Good initiative.</span></p>"

Lime&rsquo;s creative solution called &ldquo;The Trojan High&rdquo; involved selling young people &ldquo;Ciao&rdquo;, a supposed new &ldquo;legal high&rdquo; that was in actuality just a package with safety messages in it. This showed the recipients that when buying &ldquo;legal highs&rdquo; you didn&rsquo;t know what you were really getting. And the campaign slogan was &ldquo;Ciao!

The campaign in Luton kicked off our work in a very creative way by suggesting that a new &lsquo;legal high&rsquo; had been made to get around the law.&nbsp; It caused quite a stir but got people talking about how they were being duped. The team from Lime worked really hard on the project with lots of innovative ideas and it was a pleasure to work with them.&rdquo;</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/100353_1447_main_lime.jpg\" alt=\"Lime marketing team Pip award\"\/></p><p>In May 2016 the UK government banned the production, distribution and sale of &ldquo;legal highs&rdquo;, which are also referred to as new psychoactive substances (NPS).

WMF was looking for help with their marketing and communications strategy and Faiz was happy to get involved to see how he could best support their work.</p><p>Three years on Faiz has supported the charity in many ways and is now an official board member. And most recently he is using his passion for writing children&rsquo;s books to help raise money for WMF&rsquo;s important work.</p><p>Nazlie Chan-Wing-Yen, Project Coordinator for WMF, said &ldquo;Faiz has been and is a great asset to WMF as he understands the medical side of our work as well as our marketing needs and it was so exciting when he came up with the idea of the book to raise funds&rdquo;.</p><p>Faiz has written several children&rsquo;s books with humorous themes such as <em>The Frog in the Skyscraper</em> and <em>The Frog Who Loved Mathematics</em>. His latest publication <em>The Frog Who was Blue</em> goes on sale on the 28<sup>th</sup> of January and can be purchased through <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Frog-Who-Was-Blue/dp/1785899953\">Amazon</a> or <a href=\"http://www.troubador.co.uk/book_info.asp?bookid=4175\">Troubador Publishing</a>.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/frog_who_was_blue.jpg\" alt=\"The Frog Who Was Blue\"\/>&nbsp;</p><p>Faiz said, &ldquo;We thought that a children&rsquo;s book, with a story set in Malawi, might make for an entertaining diversion for children attending the clinics.&rdquo; His new book features protagonist Biriwita, a blue frog who longs to be accepted at Croak College, the most famous school for frogs in Malawi. However, when he gets there he has to overcome the struggle of appearing to be very different from the all the frogs around him.</p><p>&ldquo;We hope that the book can raise the profile of WMF, since the charity&rsquo;s life-saving work relies entirely on donations,&rdquo; comments Faiz. &ldquo;WMF&rsquo;s focus is on the region&rsquo;s poorest and most vulnerable children, including AIDS orphans.&rdquo;</p><p>Graphic designer <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/professionals/more_information/3196\" target=\"_blank\">Naomi Powell</a> was also recruited through Pimp My Cause to create the playful and colourful illustrations for <em>The Frog Who Was Blue</em>.</p><p>Book sales will support the ongoing work of WMF, which treats 25,000 children each year. Their mobile clinic brings medical staff and supplies to the remotest parts of Africa and delivers life-saving medical care. Thousands of children are alive today as a direct result of the treatment they provide.</p><p>One example of their programmes is their work with children affected by AIDS. In 2005 antiretroviral medicine became available free of charge in Malawi for everyone infected with the AIDS virus, however children under 13 years of age were excluded.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/landrover_with_girl.jpg\" alt=\"World Medical Fund\" \/></p><p>Nazlie said, &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t stand by and watch innocent children suffer the painful and undignified death that is the final outcome of AIDS so began our own programme, buying the antiretroviral medicine at an annual cost of $500 per child. But many of the children are orphans and it was difficult to ensure they attended every month for essential ongoing clinical appraisals and the prescription of their medicine.</p><p>&ldquo;So we opened the&nbsp;Thandizo centre, which is unlike any other medical centre. It is a playground and a sports centre, with games, toys and even a TV. These are diversions for children that simply do not exist in Nkhotakota.

Humanitarian actors have to be able to zoom in on important details as well as see the big picture, fast.&nbsp;</p><p>ACAPS supports humanitarian actors by providing independent analysis&nbsp;to contribute to evidence-based decision making and when needed they deploy experts&nbsp;to provide assessment and analysis on the ground in unfolding crises.</p><p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kmVSdjPLBdY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>And they&rsquo;ve recently launched <a href=\"http://acapscrisisalertapp.acaps.org/\" target=\"_blank\">a new app</a> to make it easier for humanitarians to access the right information and analysis wherever they may be.</p><p>Caroline Draveny, Communications Officer at ACAPS, said &ldquo;Eleanor provided us with excellent marketing and communications support. She contributed to the success of the launch of our new app, by helping us to put in place a comprehensive strategy.

We worked hard to improve ACAPS SEO and to optimise conversion rates on the website, as well as finding innovative ways to reach the target market, always with a great ROI. I have been really pleased to see the fruits of our labour, as we have optimized the UX/UI on the app, defined its market positioning, branding and put a successful cross-channel campaign into place to launch it. We have seen our download and user targets achieved 110% without a huge budget. This project shows what can be achieved with limited resources, and lots of energy. There is so much potential out there for anyone who is prepared to roll up their sleeves and develop a plan.&rdquo;</p>"

For some time I've been aware of the very unfair coverage that particular minorities have been receiving in the media, as well as the very agenda-driven content that particular media groups have been publishing. I felt that more needed to be done to raise awareness of this \"hateful\" and fear-mongering coverage that some parts of the press seem to thrive on spreading, so decided to start the \"Don't Fund Hate\" project.</p><p>Since setting it up we've become aware of other well-established groups that are working towards the same goals as us - such as the Sleeping Giants group, or the Stop Funding Hate group. We see ourselves as working on the same page as these groups, helping to make brands aware of their advertisements which are appearing on these hateful publications.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/rspb_pull_ads_on.jpg\" alt=\"RSPB pulls ads on Global Warming hoax sites\"\/></p><p>We're not advocating the end of free speech, but are simply against the idea of media groups being able to monetise their hateful content in this manner. Many brands are simply unaware that their adverts are appearing on these types of right-wing extremist websites, so we are trying to encourage brands to think about the impact that these ad placements might have on their own brand. As a consumer would you be happy to buy a product from a company which helps to fund an extremist site such as Breitbart?<br\/> <br\/>After starting the project I soon realised we needed to have some top quality material in order for us to make as much of an impact as we can, and now that means we needed to have a clear message and marketing material to suit this. A clean yet visually striking logo was therefore essential to us and that's what led us on to Pimp My Cause. We created our profile and put up a request for help and within a few days <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/professionals/more_information/4219\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Jameson</a> got in touch offering to help.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/dont_fund_hate_logo.jpg\" alt=\"Don't Fund Hate logo created through Pimp My Cause\"\/></p><p>Daniel is a student graphic designer looking to get more practical, hands-on experience and get some exposure for his work. We exchanged messages and I gave a very brief description about what we wanted to show with our logo and exactly what kind of message we hoped to spread.</p><p>Daniel came back within the next day with some brilliant designs, and within a few days we were up and running with our shiny new logo! Daniel was brilliant to work with; he was always available to discuss the project and came up with some great ideas. We felt very lucky to have been able to meet Daniel through the Pimp My Cause platform and now we're set to continue our project, armed with a new logo (and an additional banner that Daniel kindly created too).</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/dont_fund_hate_banner.jpg\" alt=\"Don't Fund Hate banner designed by marketing volunteer Daniel Jameson\"\/></p><p>We asked Daniel to share his thoughts about his work with Don&rsquo;t Fund Hate, \"The logo design was based around typography in keeping with the serious nature of the cause, the square is to represent how the cause thinks outside the box and a sans-serif typeface was selected to add an element of boldness.&nbsp;And the colours were selected from the client website, to allow for a development of the logo instead of a complete design overhaul&rdquo;.</p>"

After 18 months of volunteering, one of her patients suggested she spread her services to hospices everywhere and the concept of <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/causes/details/4129\" target=\"_blank\">The Hospice Biographers</a> was born.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/hb_pic.jpg\" alt=\"Hospice Biographers gain marketing support\"\/></p><p><span>The Hospice Biographers was founded in 2016 and is launching its first public campaign on October 10<sup>th</sup>. The charity plans to offer terminally ill patients the chance to have their life stories professionally recorded on audio. This will give people the opportunity to &ldquo;tell their stories&rdquo; to help them make sense of their lives as a whole and to create something that will be cherished forever.</span></p><p><span>These days we&rsquo;re used to keeping family photos, but very few of us have voice recordings to remember people by. And yet nothing is more unique and meaningful than listening to the voice of a loved one.</span></p><p><span>The charity&rsquo;s service will be free of charge and will be offered to 200 hospices across the country within the next five years. Interviews will be conducted by volunteer journalists, hospice staff and communications professionals, who will be trained by the charity in regional clusters across the UK.</span></p><p><span>Secure hardware will be used that has been custom designed for the charity by Coomber Electronic Equipment. After being interviewed, patients will be given a USB memory stick containing their audio recording. Thereafter the interviews will be securely uploaded to an online digital database hosted with the cloud storage company Box. The audio life stories will remain strictly confidential for a minimum of ten years although patients will be able to give their friends and family access to their recordings.</span></p><p><span>The charity&rsquo;s founder, </span><span>Barbara Altounyan, signed up to Pimp My Cause in May looking for help with their marketing strategy. Barbara clearly had a huge amount of passion for creating this charity, as well as specialist knowledge and a strong network to support its development, but she knew that they also needed business and marketing support to grow and achieve the charity&rsquo;s goals. We connected Barbara with <a href=\"http://www.pimpmycause.org/professionals/more_information/3997\" target=\"_blank\">Jenni Hughes</a>, an experienced marketer and business coach.</span></p><p><span>Over the last few months Jenni and Barbara have been working to improve the charity&rsquo;s communications through their website and social media in preparation for their launch next month. This work has made the vision for Hospice Biographers much clearer and more engaging.</span></p><p><span>Jenni said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been really&nbsp;fortunate to get involved with The Hospice Biographers. It's not only given me an opportunity to learn more about launching a charity and how it impacts social media channels; but it has been wonderful to meet Barbara and her&nbsp;patrons and trustees of the charity&nbsp;who really make the charity what it is. It is an inspirational charity and it's wonderful to be at the beginning of a journey for them as their&nbsp;audio digital archive is set to become the largest library of its kind ever created in the UK&rdquo;.</span></p><p><span>Barbara and the charity&rsquo;s trustees have been so pleased with Jenni&rsquo;s contributions that they have asked her to become their newest Trustee and to continue to support the development of their business and marketing strategies.</span></p><p><span><img src=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/pimp-my-cause-media-dev/uploads/images/news/hb_patrons.jpg\" alt=\"Hospice Biographers patrons support October launch\"\/></span></p><p><span>The charity has also won the support of Ed Sheeran and David Suchet who&rsquo;ve both made films for their media launch next month.</span></p><p><span>The Hospice Biographers are now looking for pro bono marketing support to help them move forwards, engage volunteers and promote their services.
